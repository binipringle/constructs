## Overview

**1787 Constitution**

- {:.indent-0}Article I: National Legislature (Congress)
- {:.indent-2}Bicameral:
- {:.indent-4}House of Representatives: by population.
- {:.indent-4}Senate: 2 Senators per State.
- {:.indent-2}“Enumerated powers” concept (but Constitution vastly expanded national legislative power from that granted by the Articles of Confederation).
- {:.indent-0}Article II: National Executive (President)
- {:.indent-0}Article III: National Judiciary
- {:.indent-0}Article IV: States
- {:.indent-0}Article V: Amendment process (very difficult)
- {:.indent-0}Article VI: Federal Supremacy (within a system of “dual sovereignty”)
- {:.indent-2}"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof, and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby; any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2.""

Comparing the Constitution to the Articles of Confederation that it replaced, we see major structural and institutional changes effected by the 1787 Constitution (i.e., how the Constitution altered the institutions of government, the powers assigned to those institutions, and the theory of sovereignty underlying the National Government).  Why were those changes made?

## Major themes and concepts

Constitutions serve two major functions. These are (1) recognize and protect individual and group rights, and (2) “constitute” the government by creating institutions, specifying their powers, and establishing the ground rules. The two central concepts in this course are **federalism** and **separation of powers**.

What does “federalism” mean in the U.S. context?

- {:.indent-0}Federalism issues are now highly contested and in flux:
- {:.indent-2}(A) New Deal (1930s) - 1970s: federalism issues settled/stable; broad deference to congressional power.
- {:.indent-2}(B) 1980s: “states’ rights” revival in political, and judicial realm. Federalism issues become increasingly contested.
- {:.indent-2}(C) 1990s - present: states’ rights campaign achieves dominance on Supreme Court, often at expense of other constitutional values.
- {:.indent-2}(D) Judicial activism deployed to advance states’ rights theory of federalism.

A major question in US constitutional law has been whether and to what extent the judiciary should define and enforce federalism-based limits (aka, “states-rights” limits) on the national government. The question of how power should be allocated between the national government and state governments (aka, federalism issues) has no intrinsic political valence. However, federalism issues often divide Supreme Court on political/ideological lines.  	 

[What role has “states’ rights” -- and judicial enforcement of “states’ rights” -- played in U.S. history?  Note inversion of states’ rights questions during Trump administration.]

What does “separation of powers” mean in the U.S. context?

Unlike LEDP, Constitutional Structures focuses on governmental powers, not on individual rights.  But these two dimensions of the constitutional system -- rights and powers --  are closely intertwined.

What is the primary purpose of the Constitution’s double dispersion of public power: horizontally between the 3 branches of the national government , and vertically, between the national government and the states?

Recent Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Constitution:

- {:.indent-2}Parents Involved (2007):  The Constitution bars states and localities from using most (maybe any) race conscious measures to keep public schools from becoming segregated by race.
- {:.indent-2}Citizens United (2010): The Constitution bars regulation of corporate spending on elections - leaves government powerless to prevent flooding of the political process with corporate wealth.
- {:.indent-2}Shelby County (2013):  The Constitution bars Congress from maintaining key provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that had curbed state actions disenfranchising people of color.

Frederick Douglass, “The Constitution of the United States: Is It Pro-Slavery or Anti-slavery?” (1860)

First let me state what is not the question… It is not whether slavery existed in the United States at the time of the adoption of the Constitution; it is not whether slaveholders took part in the framing of the Constitution; it is not whether those slaveholders, in their hearts, intended to secure certain advantages for slavery; it is not whether the American Government has been wielded during seventy-two years in favour of the propagation and permanence of slavery; it is not whether a pro-slavery interpretation has been put upon the Constitution by the American Courts —
The real and exact question [is whether] the United States Constitution guarantees to any class of people the right to enslave, or hold as property, any other class of people in that country…
The American Government and the American Constitution are spoken of in a manner which would naturally lead the hearer to believe that one is identical with the other; when the truth is, they are distinct in character as is a ship and a compass. The one may point right and the other steer wrong. The Constitution may be right, the Government wrong. If the Government has been governed by mean, sordid, and wicked passions, it does not follow that the Constitution is mean, sordid, and wicked.  If the South has made the Constitution bend to the purposes of slavery, let the North now make that instrument bend to the cause of freedom and justice.

What are the implications of Douglass’s argument? Why might he have adopted this stance (while other abolitionists condemned the Constitution as pro-slavery)?

Possible rationales for supporting the Constitution are (1) "rule of law” rationale; and (2) pragmatic or “consequentialist” rationale.  

The “rule of law” rationale rests on the circumstances of the founding that speak to the legitimacy (or not) of the Constitution at adoption, and thus the rule-of-law rationale for supporting it.

The “consequentialist” rationale focuses on the implications for how the courts should interpret the Constitution. These include the use of “originalism” (especially from founding era); interpreting the constitution as a “living constitution” v. fixed meaning; and the role of courts in democratic society.

## Slavery and the Constitution

Const. Art. I, § 2: "Representatives … shall be apportioned among the several States … according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons."

Const. Art. I, §9, cl. 1: "The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to the Year [1808]."

Const. Art. IV §2: "No Person held to Service or Labor in one State under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall . . . be discharged from such Service or Labor, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom Service or Labor may be due.""

Const. Art. V: ""... no Amendment which shall be made prior to the Year [1808] shall in any manner affect [Art. I, §9, cl. 1]."

Const. Art. II, § 1: Presidents chosen by “electoral votes,” not popular vote.

Likely results during founding era if Presidents chosen by direct vote of enfranchised people, not through Electoral College?

- {:.indent-2}2000 Election: George W. Bush loses popular vote – becomes President.
- {:.indent-2}2016 Election: Trump loses popular vote by 2.9 million – becomes President.
- {:.indent-2}2020 Election: Joe Biden wins popular vote by over 7 million; but a change of about 100k votes could have given an electoral college victory to Trump.

At the Constitution's Bicentennial in 1987, Chief Justice Thurgood Marshall said "[t]he focus of this celebration invites a complacent belief that the vision of those who debated and compromised in Philadelphia yielded the "more perfect Union" it is said we now enjoy. I cannot accept this invitation, for I do not believe that the meaning of the Constitution was forever "fixed" at the Philadelphia Convention. Nor do I find the wisdom, foresight, and sense of justice exhibited by the Framers particularly profound. To the contrary, the government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and momentous social transformation to attain the system of constitutional government, and its respect for the individual freedoms and human rights, we hold as fundamental today." *Commemorating the Wrong Document?* (1987).  

When contemporary Americans cite "The Constitution," they invoke a concept that is vastly different from what the Framers barely began to construct two centuries ago.

## Wealth, class, economic inequality, and the Constitution

**Federalists** were proponents of the proposed Constitution. **Antifederalists** opposed the proposed Constitution. There was **one point of agreement**: A political system organized on the principle of democratic self-governance is in severe tension (and perhaps inconsistent) with an economic system that generates and protects large disparities of wealth.

A significant motivation for Federalists was protection of existing property rights and wealth distribution from “excess” democracy. Madison at the closed constitutional debates in Philadelphia:
“In future times a great majority of the people will not only be without land, but any other sort of property. These may combine under the influence of their common situation; in which case the rights of property will not be secure.”

Some warning signs for Federalists were (1) powerful egalitarian ethos following the Revolution; (2) redistributive state legislation; and (3) Shay’s rebellion. Federalist response to these threats was constitutional design.

**Federalist No. 10**

Premises:
	• main threat in system of self-government danger of “factions.”
	• greatest cause of factions is disparities of property and wealth.
	• a central object of government is protection of property rights.
	• state redistributive legislation is “wicked” and “improper” (Madison specially condemns “a rage for paper money, for an abolition of debt and for an equal distribution of property”).
Solutions: Federalist 10 and 51 Blueprint
	(1) Set government power at a remove from the people (rejection of 			“pure 	democracy”).
	(2) Build inertia into federal government (separation of powers/ 			“checks and balances”).
Q: How does the Constitution make action by the national government difficult?
Q: How do such restraints protect property rights and existing distribution of wealth?
	(3) Impose direct limits on state governments (e.g., Article I, §10).

Competing political philosophies and models of government at founding
	[Text p. 15 et seq]
	Classical Republicanism
	Pluralism (aka 18th C Liberalism)
	“Madisonian Republicanism”
1. Classical Republicanism:
	• advanced by antifederalists
	• decentralized, democratic self-governance
	• citizens animated by “civic virtue” - pursuit of common good
	• wide disparities of wealth must be avoided to minimize factions

2. Pluralism (18th century liberalism):
	• doubt concept of “the common good”
	• self-interest, not civic virtue, dominant motivator
	• faction inevitable
	• “the good” is maximization of private interests
	• role of government is to create fair process / ground rules

3. Madisonian Republicanism (synthesis of 1 & 2):
	• faction unavoidable - government cannot erase self-interest
	• but government must advance the common good, not simply facilitate 		private interests
	• means to accomplish set out in Federalist 10 & 51:
		remove power from direct control of people through system of 			representation; and encourage civic virtue in the representatives.
