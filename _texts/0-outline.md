---

## I. Purpose

The purposes of the FRE are to (1) help the jury reach a fair and just determination, (2) eliminate unjustifiable expense and delay, and (3) promote the development of evidence law. **Rule 102**.

---

## II. Authentication

**Rule 901(a)** To admit evidence, the court requires that the evidence be authenticated. To authenticate evidence, the proponent of evidence must produce evidence that shows that the evidence the proponent seeks to admit is really the evidence the proponent claims it to be.

### Types of evidence

**Oral testimony:**

- {:.indent-2}**Fact witnesses** are “people who perceived facts related to the lawsuit and testify about those facts.” The law does not give “eyewitness” special status over other kinds of fact witness.
- {:.indent-2}**Expert witnesses** “use specialized knowledge to interpret evidence or explain it to the jury.” Do not need to have firsthand knowledge of the controversy in question.
- {:.indent-2}**Character witnesses** “offer information about the good or the bad character of a party or witness.” The FRE limits the use of character witnesses.

**Real evidence** is “any physical evidence that a party claims played a direct role in the controversy.” For “real” evidence to be admitted into evidence, someone has to request it be admitted in a request to admit or a pretrial conference. To admit evidence, the court requires that the evidence be authenticated or identified. (**Rule 901**).  

**Documentary evidence** is any type of writing or recording of information.

**Demonstrative evidence** is an object that did not play a role in the disputed events. Charts, tables, pictures, maps and graphs are common types of demonstrative evidence.

**Stipulations** are when both parties agree on a fact. When they do, they can stipulate that the fact is true for the purposes of litigation.

**Judicial Notice**: “if a fact is indisputably true (…) the trial judge can take judicial notice of the fact.” The fact must be either “generally known” or “accurately and readily determined.” (p. 10)

**Circumstantial evidence** (FRE does not use this phrase) is “any evidence that requires the jury to make an inference connecting the evidence with a disputed fact.” Compare with

**Direct evidence** directly establishes a contested fact and requires no inferential bridge.

**Indirect evidence** requires the jury to make more inferential leaps.

---

## III. Raising and resolving evidentiary objections

**Motion to suppress** is a pretrial motion that argues that the opposing party’s evidence was illegally obtained.

**Motion in limine** is a pretrial motion to exclude evidence. "The purpose of such motions is to perform a gatekeeping function and permit the trial judge to eliminate from further consideration evidentiary submissions that clearly ought not to be presented to the jury because they clearly would be inadmissible for any purpose. … The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating blanket inadmissibility." (Wielgus v. Ryobi Techs [table saw case])

**Objection** is made in trial to stop the other party from admitting evidence not allowed by the FRE. An objection is made before the evidence is admitted. If evidence is inadmissible but a party does not object in time and/or fails to state the specific ground of the objection, the evidence might be admitted.

**Motion to strike** is made in trial when an item of evidence not allowed by the FRE has already entered the record.  A motion to strike is a recourse a party uses when they weren’t fast enough to forestall objectionable evidence; if the motion to strike is granted, the judge tells the jury that the item is struck from the evidence and they should ignore.  

**Offer of proof**. If one party objects to the evidence they can make an offer of proof to show the judge what the evidence entails. *If the party doesn’t make the offer of proof, the party waives the right to object on appeal.* If the substance of the evidence is apparent from the context, the party doesn’t have to make an offer of proof. ( pp. 44-45)

---

## IV. Preserving claims of error

**Rule 103**. If there was an error in an evidentiary ruling, a party may claim error if the erroneous ruling affects a substantial right of the party **and**

- {:.indent-2}(I) if the ruling admits evidence, a party
- {:.indent-4}(A) timely objects or moves to strike; **and**
- {:.indent-4}(B) states the specific ground, unless it was apparent from the context; **or**
- {:.indent-2}(II) if the ruling excludes evidence, a party informs the court of its substance by an offer of proof, unless the substance was apparent from the context.

A **substantial right of a party** is affected when there is a reasonable probability that had the judge not made the error, the outcome of the trial would have been different.

**Plain error** is an error that is so egregious that a reasonable person would lose faith in the justice system. A court may take notice of a plain error affecting a substantial right, even if the claim of error was not properly preserved. **103(e).**

- {:.indent-2}**U.S. v. Gomez-Norena (9th Cir. 1990)** (district court did not commit plain error by admitting the drug courier profile testimony for the limited purpose of providing the jury with background information).

- {:.indent-2}****U.S. v. Smalls (10th Cir. 2014)** (while incarcerated accused of murdering other incarcerated person, who had asthma, by smothering; raised four evidentiary objections; appellate court reviewed for abuse of discretion considering the record as a whole and found no plain error; "The plain error standard presents a heavy burden for an appellant" and "is to be used sparingly.")

To be successful on appeal, an appellant must convince the appellate court that the trial judge’s evidentiary determination was **both** (1) (a) abuse of discretion and (b) plain error, **and** (2) a substantial right was violated.

**Reversible error** is an error by a trial judge that affects a substantial right of a party.

**Harmless error** is when the error did not affect a substantial right because there was other evidence that supported the trial verdict.  

---

## V. Limiting Instructions

A **limiting instruction** is an instruction from the judge to the jury, telling the jury to disregard evidence for a specific purpose or against a party.

**Rule 105** provides that if the court admits evidence that is admissible for one purpose (or against one party) but not another, the court, on timely request, must restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly. Such instructions are not always easy for juries to follow, but the courts need to suppose that juries will follow instructions. Relying on that supposition, Rule 105 aims to ensure that proceedings are fair.

---
## VI. Preliminary Questions

**Rule 104(a)** provides that the judge decides any preliminary question about whether a witness is qualified, a privilege exists, or evidence is admissible on its face. When deciding this question, the judge is not bound by rules of evidence except those on privilege. The standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence.

**Rule 104(b)** provides that when the relevance of evidence depends on whether a fact exists, proof must be introduced sufficient to support a finding that the fact does exist.

- {:.indent-2}**Dowling v. U.S. (1990)** (Dowling accused of robbing bank wearing ski mask; judge allowed prosecution to bring evidence that Dowling tried to rob a house two weeks later wearing a ski mask even though Dowling was acquitted in the house robbery where there was reasonable doubt; however, a reasonable jury could still find by a preponderance of the evidence that Dowling robbed the house)

---

## VII. Relevance

**Rule 401** of the Federal Rules of Evidence states that evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable than that fact would be without that evidence. A fact of consequence is a fact that goes to prove or disprove some part of an element of a claim, charge or defense, cause of action or theory of the case. The broad admissibility written into this rule is to allow parties to bring in as much evidence as possible so that a jury or judge can render a fair and just determination of the case. Relevance supports efficiency by keeping the jury focused on relevant facts.

- {:.indent-2}**Hitchcock v. Walsh hypo** (D crossed center line of highway, hitting P's car and seriously injuring P, who sued D for negligence claiming D drunk; D seeks to admit W testimony that D was sober 3 hours before accident; P argues 3 hours long time but court finds relevant because any tendency)

- {:.indent-2}**Walsh v. Hospital hypo** (Walsh sued hospital for medical malpractice where following car accident nurse gave him wrong medicine causing permanent paralysis; defendant's drunkenness was fact of consequence and W testimony relevant because any tendency)

- {:.indent-2}**U.S. v. Roger Stone (USDC for District of Columbia, 2019)** (Movie clip from the Godfather is relevant to place defendant’s statements about Frank Panganeli in context by showing the jury the image that Stone intended to evoke in Person 2’s mind when he named  Panganeli)

- {:.indent-2}**U.S. v. Boros (7th Cir. 2012)** (admission of doctor's testimony about type of medications Boros sold over internet was harmless error because minimal relevance, minimal probative value, and despite overtones of prejudice, excluding doctor's testimony would not have led an "average juror" to find that the evidence was "significantly less persuasive.")

- {:.indent-2}**Wielgus v. Ryobi Techs., Inc. (Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, 2012)** (motion in limine to bar plaintiff from presenting video and in-court demonstrations of SawStop Technology on model not substantially similar to model that caused injury denied without prejudice because SawStop functions in the same manner on both models and the probative value of the demonstration could substantially outweigh the danger of any unfair prejudice)

- {:.indent-2}**Hypo** Alan is accused of selling cocaine. Prosecutor offers evidence that Alan regularly uses marijuana. Prosecutor would say relevant because Alan is charged with selling an illegal drug, and use of an illegal drug – marijuana – has some tendency to show that Alan knows and handles drugs. Defense would argue that use of a drug is unlike selling a drug. Just because I eat food doesn’t mean I sell food. Furthermore, marijuana is very different from cocaine. Cocaine is a schedule II drug and marijuana is a schedule I drug. Marijuana is legal in some states and cocaine is illegal everywhere. Defendant could raise 403. Could say jury might think that a drug user could sell drugs.

- {:.indent-2}**Hypo** Greg (D) is accused of assaulting Alex. Prosecutor calls a psychic to the stand, who testifies that the day before the assault, she had a vision of the future in which she saw Alex stabbing Greg’s wife with a steak knife. D objects that not relevant under 401. The issue is whether the psychic's testimony is relevant.
- {:.indent-5}**Offer of proof:** Psychic testifies that greg visited her every week and has done so for the past 15 years, has always followed her advice and believed her visions, and that she related this vision to him the morning of the assault.
- {:.indent-5}**Relevance:** Prosecution would say Psychic's testimony is relevant because it could give Greg  motive. Although prosecutors don’t have to show motive, it is relevant because it ties it all together. Defense would say it’s not relevant because hearsay and because the inferential leap is too great. We are expected to infer Greg’s reaction to being told that Alex stabbed his wife is to assault the person who allegedly stabbed his wife.

401 and 403 often play off each other.  

---

## VIII. Prejudice

If a judge finds that evidence is unfairly prejudicial, they may exclude it under **Rule 403**. Courts find that relevant evidence is unfairly prejudicial if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence. Prejudice must be unfair. Unfair prejudice is when evidence will lead a jury to make a decision on an improper ground. Rule 403 provides judges with the means to counterbalance the broad admissibility of evidence that other rules allow so as to make proceedings fair, minimize expense, and help the court reach a just determination.

- {:.indent-2}**State v. Poe, 21 Utah 113 (1968)** (Trial court abused discretion in admitting gruesome colored slides from autopsy because identity and cause of death was already established with black and white photographs and color slides were only offered by prosecution to inflame and arouse the jury so that they would recommend the death sentence rather than life imprisonment; reversed and remanded because of abuse of discretion and "other doubtful aspects of the trial")

- {:.indent-2}**Haley, v. Gross, McKee, and Ellis, 86 F.3d 630 (7th Cir. 1996)** (trial court did not abuse discretion by admitting photograph of burned cell with dead body of Haley's cellmate because while disturbing, its contents were highly relevant, and its very significant probative value was not substantially outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice; nor did trial court abuse discretion by admitting photograph of Haley in hospital severely burned and with leg shackles because not prejudicial)  

---

## IX. Witness Competency

**Rule 601** states that every person is competent to be a witness unless the Federal Rules, or, in a civil case, state law, provide otherwise. **Rule 602** limits Rule 601 by providing that a witness may testify to a matter only if the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may consist of the witness’s testimony. To have personal knowledge, a witness must (1) be able to perceive the events they are testifying to, (2) be able to understand and take an oath or affirmation that they will tell the truth (**Rule 603**), and (3) have memory (recall) of the events and the ability to narrate.

A judge cannot be a witness (Rule 605) and a member of the jury cannot be a witness in a case which they are sitting on the jury for (Rule 606).

A **Leading question** can be asked in cross examination, but only about information that was provided in direct examination. You can also ask leading questions in redirect examination and recross examination but only about information provided in direct examination and cross examination (**Rule 611**).

## X. Witness Impeachment

Witnesses can be impeached for incompetency, bias, prior inconsistent statement and general character for untruthfulness. Sometimes, extrinsic evidence can be brought in to impeach.

**Extrinsic evidence** is any evidence other than testimony from the witness already on the stand (Merritt 228).  

**Collateral and non-collateral**. Extrinsic evidence can be collateral or non-collateral. A collateral matter is relevant to the case solely because it impeaches a witness. A non-collateral matter proves a fact of consequence other than impeachment. Judges use their discretion under rules 403 and 611 to prohibit extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement on a purely collateral matter, but parties may present extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statements related to non-collateral matters (Merritt 229).

### Bias

“Bias is a term used in the ‘common law of evidence’ to describe the relationship between a party and a witness which might lead the witness to slant, unconsciously or otherwise, his testimony in favor of or against a party. Bias may be induced by a witness's like, dislike, or fear of a party, or by the witness's self-interest.” (U.S. v. Abel)

- {:.indent-2}**U.S. v. Abel (1984)**
- {:.indent-5}Extrinsic evidence to show bias is Ehle’s testimony that Ehle, Mills and Abel (defendant accused of bank robbery) were members of a secret prison organization whose members took an oath to deny its existence and “lie, cheat, steal [and] kill” to protect each other. This evidence is offered by the prosecution to rebut Mills (defendant’s witness)’s testimony that prior to Ehle’s testimony incriminating Abel, Ehle had told Mills that he (Ehle) was going to testify falsely against Abel. The prosecution brings the extrinsic evidence of membership in the secret prison organization to demonstrate that Mills is potentially biased in favor of Abel.
- {:.indent-2}something


### Prior Inconsistent Statement

Under Rule 613(b), extrinsic evidence of a witness’s prior inconsistent statement is admissible if the witness is given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement and the other party is given the opportunity to examine the witness about it. Implicit in Rule 613 is that counsel can question a witness about inconsistencies.

| Witness’s | governing rule | question on cross | offer extrinsic evidence |
| Ability to perceive, recall, narrate | 601 | yes | yes |
| Ability to understand and take oath | 603 | yes	| yes |
| Personal knowledge  | 602	| yes	| yes |
| Bias | 611(b)	| yes	| yes |
| Prior Inconsistent Statements | 613	| yes	| yes |

Rules: 607, 611, 613; Review 403 as needed; Readings: Text: Ch 17, 18; Additional Material: Abel, Taylor, Kelly

### Witness Impeachment for Character for Untruthfulness**

Rule 404(a)(1) provides that evidence of a person’s character or character trait is not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait. **Rule 404(a)** thus excludes most character evidence. **Rule 608** lets some character evidence back in by allowing inquiry into specific instances of conduct probative of the witness’s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, during cross-examination.

**Rule 608(a)** allows any party to offer opinion or reputation evidence to attack a fact witness’s character for truthfulness.

**Rule 608(b)** allows the attorney during cross-examination to inquire into specific instances of a witness’s conduct to prove truthfulness or untruthfulness. When the attorney inquires into specific instances of a witness’s conduct under 608(b), they are attempting to get the jury to infer that because the witness has a character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, it is more or less likely that the witness’s testimony is true.

Rules: 404(a)(1) and 404(a)(3), 608; Readings: Text: Ch. 19, 21, 22; Additional Material: Renda, Martinez

### Witness Impeachment for Prior Convictions to Show Character for Untruthfulness

Under **Rule 609**, evidence of convictions for crimes punishable by death or by imprisonment for more than one year must be admitted in a criminal case in which the witness is a defendant if the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to that defendant. This is because “Rule 609 is premised on the … proposition that one who has transgressed society's norms by committing a felony is less likely than most to be deterred from lying under oath” (U.S. v. Barr citing Walden v. Georgia Pac. Corp. [internal quotations omitted]). However, if more than ten years have passed since the witness’s conviction or release from confinement for the crime, whichever is later, evidence of the crime is only admitted if its probative value substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. In considering whether probativeness outweighs prejudice under Rule 609, courts use a special balancing test with five factors, which are (1) the impeachment value of the former crime; (2) the timing of the prior conviction and subsequent criminality; (3) the similarity of between the prior crime and the charged one; (4) the importance of the defendant's testimony for presenting the case; and (5) the degree to which the defendant's credibility is central to the case.

More policy: In Barr the judge, citing Caldwell, said that the rationale of 609(a)(1) is that “commission of a felony-grade offense bespeaks a willingness to disregard social norms, and therefore bears on the likelihood that a witness would testify truthfully.”

**Rule 609(a)(1)(2)** states that any crime, regardless of the punishment, must be admitted if their establishment proved that the witness committed a dishonest act or false statement. A dishonest act is fraud, misrepresentation or theft. A misdemeanor involving a dishonest act that (a) was committed as adult and (b) for which conviction occurred ten years ago or less is automatically admitted. No balancing test applies.

If evidence is admitted under Rule 609, a party can still use **Rule 403** to argue that the probative value of the evidence to prove the witness’s general character for truthfulness or untruthfulness is substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.

### Privileges - Spousal or Marital

Readings: Text: Ch. 68 (Read pp 891-899, skim rest of chapter)
Additional Material: Brock

"The **marital communications privilege** covers "information privately disclosed between husband and wife in the confidence of the marital relationship . . . ." Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 51, 100 S. Ct. 906, 63 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1980); The marital communications privilege belongs to both spouses, so either spouse may invoke the privilege to avoid testifying or to prevent the other from testifying about the privileged communication. The marital communications privilege exists "to ensure that spouses . . . feel free to communicate their deepest feelings  to each other without fear of eventual exposure in a court of law." United States v. Lofton, 957 F.2d 476, 477 (7th Cir. 1992), quoting Byrd, 750 F.2d at 590. The marital communications privilege applies even after the marriage has dissolved, but the protected subject matter includes only what one spouse communicates to the other, not what one spouse learns about the other in other ways, such as by observing the other's actions." (Brock)

"The second marital privilege, the **spousal testimonial privilege**, applies to any adverse testimony one spouse might provide as a witness against the other in a criminal case.  It is both broader and narrower than the marital communications privilege. It is broader in that it covers testimony on any adverse facts, no matter how they might have become known to the witness-spouse. It is narrower in that it applies only to adverse testimony in a criminal case, and it applies only during the marriage. See Byrd, 750 F.2d at 590-91; United States v. Fisher, 518 F.2d 836, 838 (2d Cir. 1975). Until the Supreme Court's decision in Trammel, either spouse could invoke the spousal testimonial privilege, so that a defendant could prevent his spouse from testifying against him, even willingly. See, e.g., Hawkins v. United States, 358 U.S. 74, 78-79, 79 S. Ct. 136, 3 L. Ed. 2d 125 (1958). In Trammel v. United States, however, the Court modified the privilege so that only the witness-spouse can invoke the privilege to refuse to testify adversely." (Brock)
