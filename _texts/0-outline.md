## I. Purpose

**Rule 102**

"These rules should be construed so as to administer every proceeding fairly, eliminate unjustifiable expense and delay, and promote the development of evidence law, to the end of ascertaining the truth and securing a just determination." Fed. R. Evid. 102

- {:.indent-2}Help jury reach fair and just determination
- {:.indent-2}Minimize expense and delay
- {:.indent-2}Promote development of evidence law

## II. Authentication

**Types of evidence**

FRE does not use the phrase **“circumstantial evidence”** but the text book defines it as “any evidence that requires the jury to make an inference connecting the evidence with a disputed fact,” as opposed to **direct evidence**, which “directly establishes a contested fact.” (p. 14) One is not “better” or more valid than the other; it is more important to concentrate on inferences that link evidence to disputed facts than to distinguish between circumstantial and direct evidence. For **“real” evidence** (something tangible - copy of lease, surveillance video, gun, bill of lading, blue prints, etc.) to be admitted into evidence, someone has to request it be admitted in a request to admit or a pretrial conference.

**Rule**

To admit evidence, the court requires that the evidence be authenticated or identified. To authenticate or identify evidence, the proponent of evidence must produce evidence that shows that the evidence the proponent seeks to admit is really the evidence the proponent claims it to be. Rule 901(a). It is “an inherent logical necessity” that evidence be authenticated or identified (Rule 901 Advisory Committee Notes citing 7 Wigmore §2129, p. 564), but authentication does not guarantee the identity or genuineness of a piece of evidence, and a piece of evidence will not automatically be admitted just because it is authenticated.

**Types of evidence**

- **Oral testimony** is offered as evidence by fact witnesses, expert witnesses and character witnesses (pp 6-7).
- {:.indent-3}**Fact witnesses** are “people who perceived facts related to the lawsuit and testify about those facts.” The law does not give “eyewitness” special status over other kinds of fact witness.
- {:.indent-3}**Expert witnesses** “use specialized knowledge to interpret evidence or explain it to the jury.” Do not need to have firsthand knowledge of the controversy in question.
- {:.indent-3}**Character witnesses** “offer information about the good or the bad character of a party or witness.” The FRE limits the use of character witnesses.
- **Real evidence** is “any physical evidence that a party claims played a direct role in the controversy.” (p. 8)
- **Documentary evidence** "encompasses any type of writing or recording of information.” (p. 8)
- **Demonstrative evidence** is “not an object that played a role in the disputed events. (…) Charts, tables, pictures, maps and graphs are common types of demonstrative evidence.” (pp. 8-9)
- **Stipulations** are when both parties agree on a fact. When they do, they can stipulate that the fact is true for the purposes of litigation. (p. 9)
- **Judicial Notice** is when “if a fact is indisputably true (…) the trial judge can take judicial notice of the fact.” The fact must be either “generally known” or “accurately and readily determined.” (p. 10)
- **Circumstantial evidence** (FRE does not use this phrase) is “any evidence that requires the jury to make an inference connecting the evidence with a disputed fact.” (p. 14). Compare with direct evidence, which “requires no inferential bridge; it directly establishes a contested fact.” (p. 14).
- {:.indent-3}*Note to ask Valentine if true: All evidence - including direct evidence - depends on some inferences. “The longer the chain of inferences, … the less likely the jury will reach the decision [a party] desire[s].” (p. 17).*

## Preserving Claims of Error

**Rule 103** provides that a party may claim error in a ruling to admit or exclude evidence only if the error affects a substantial right of the party **and** (1) if the ruling admits evidence, a party, on the record, (A) timely objects or moves to strike; **and** (B) states the specific ground, unless it was apparent from the context; **or** (2) if the ruling excludes evidence, a party informs the court of its substance by an offer of proof, unless the substance was apparent from the context. Fed. R. Evid. 103.

A court may take notice of a plain error affecting a substantial right, even if the claim of error was not properly preserved. Fed. R. Evid. 103(e). Plain error is an error that is so egregious that a reasonable person would lose faith in the justice system.

To be successful on appeal an appellant will have to convince the appellate court that the trial judge’s evidentiary determination was both abuse of discretion and plain error, and a substantial right was violated (violation of substantial right is when the outcome of the trial would have been different if that evidence had been handled differently).

---

## Limitations

**Rule 105** limits evidence that is not admissible against other parties or for other purposes. "If the court admits evidence that is admissible against a party or for a purpose--but not against another party or for another purpose--the court, on timely request, must restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly." Fed. R. Evid. 105.

---

## Relevance

Under Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence is relevant if has any tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable than it would be without that evidence. A fact of consequence is a fact that goes to prove or disprove an element of a claim, charge, defense or cause of action (theory of the case). The standard for relevance is very low. The Federal Rules of Evidence favor broad admissibility so all evidence that has a reasonable or logical connection to the point to be determined is relevant and thus potentially admissible. The policy rationale that governs the Federal Rules of Evidence is the idea that all relevant evidence should be provided to a jury or judge so that they can render a fair and just determination of the case unless that evidence is prejudicial to one of the parties. Irrelevant evidence should be left out because it could confuse the jury by unnecessarily complicating facts, thus making it harder for them to reach a fair determination, or it could compromise judicial efficiency by causing unnecessary expense or delay.

Any tendency = very low bar

- Walsh (D) crossed center line of highway and hit oncoming vehicle, seriously injuring Mary Hitchcock (P). P sued D for negligence, claiming D was driving drunk. Witness met D 3 hours before accident. Said D didn't seem drunk, didn’t smell drunk. P argues that witness’s testimony is not relevant because 3 hours is a lot; D could have got drunk within 3 hours. D’s argument that it is meets that any tendency standard. D’s attorney could say not slam dunk but any tendency.

- What if P wants to introduce evidence that Walsh was drunk when he came into the hospital?  Defense wants to keep it out. Why is Walsh’s drunkenness a fact of consequence to Hitchcock’s lawsuit but may well have not been if Walsh sued hospital who took care of him after car accident? Here Walsh’s cause of action is medical malpractice. If they dropped him, it had nothing to do with him being drunk. If defendant (hospital) can prove that he acted out – acted recklessly – because he was drunk, maybe evidence that Walsh was drunk when he arrived at hospital is relevant. However, even if evidence was admitted, it could negatively influence the jury, so defense should raise objection under 403.

- Boros sells medications over the internet. Charge is conspiracy to traffic in controlled substances.  Prosecutor brings in expert to show why it’s not a good idea to sell particular kinds of medications to a consumer without a doctor’s supervision.

- Alan is accused of selling cocaine.
- {:.indent-3}Prosecutor offers evidence that Alan regularly uses marijuana. Prosecutor would say relevant because Alan is charged with selling an illegal drug, and use of an illegal drug – marijuana – has some tendency to show that Alan knows and handles drugs.
- {:.indent-3}Defense would argue that use of a drug is unlike selling a drug. Just because I eat food doesn’t mean I sell food. Furthermore, marijuana is very different from cocaine. Cocaine is a schedule II drug and marijuana is a schedule I drug. Marijuana is legal in some states and cocaine is illegal everywhere. Defendant could raise 403. Could say jury might think that a drug user could sell drugs.

**Hypo**

Greg (D) is accused of assaulting Alex. The prosecutor calls a psychic to the stand, who testifies that the day before the assault, she had a vision of the future in which she saw Alex stabbing Greg’s wife with a steak knife. D's objection: not relevant under 401. The issue is whether the psychic's testimony is relevant.

Offer of proof: The psychic testifies that greg visited her every week and has done so for the past 15 years. She testifies that he always followed her advice and believed her visions, and that she related this vision to him the morning of the assault. Is it relevant now? Yes. It could give Greg’s motive. Although prosecutors don’t have to show motive, it is relevant because it ties it all together.

Defense attorney would still push back. Defense attorney would say that it’s not relevant because what witness said is hearsay. Say that the inferential leap is too great. We are expected to infer Greg’s reaction to being told that Alex stabbed his wife is to assault the person who allegedly stabbed his wife.

401 and 403 often play off each other.
