# Federal Judicial Power

Basic Concepts are federalism, separation of powers, power of judicial review and countermajoritarian difficulty.

---

## Federalism

Federalism is a system of dual sovereignty by which the states operate under a national or federal government but still retain certain independent powers and sovereign attributes. A major question in United States constitutional law has been whether and to what extent the judiciary should define and enforce federalism-based limits (or states' rights limits) on the national government.

---

# Federal Jurisdiction

Article III, Section 2 limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to two types. The two types of jurisdiction are **law-based jurisdiction** and **party-based jurisdiction**.

**Law-based jurisdiction** refers to the authority of federal courts to hear cases that arise under (1) the Constitution or federal law; and (2) admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Law-based jurisdiction is about the nature of the legal issues involved in the case.

**Party-based jurisdiction** refers to the types of parties involved in a case that can give federal courts the authority to hear the case. Party-based Jurisdiction gives federal courts jurisdiction over (1) controversies to which the U.S. shall be a party; (2) controversies between two or more states; (3) cases between a state and citizens of another state; (4) cases between citizens of different states where the amount in controversy is over $75,000 (diversity cases); and (5) cases affecting ambassadors and consuls.

Even if one of the above types of jurisdiction exists, a federal court must review other requirements before it can hear a case.

## Eleventh Amendment State Sovereign Immunity Limitations on Federal Judicial Power

*The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.* Eleventh Amendment.

The Eleventh Amendment provides state sovereign immunity to states. This means that private individuals cannot sue states for money damages in any court (key word is money damages).

State sovereign immunity does not give states immunity from (1) federal suits brought by one state against another state; or (2) suits brought by the federal government against a state.

Subdivisions of a state (e.g., cities, towns, and counties) do not have immunity.

A private citizen may sue a state requesting an injunction (for example, a private citizen can bring suit to enjoin a state official from acting in violation of the plaintiff’s federal constitutional rights).

A state may consent to suit in federal court if it clearly waives its Eleventh Amendment immunity. The state must do so expressly and unequivocally.

Congress has the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity in certain cases. Abrogation refers to the ability of Congress to authorize lawsuits against states, thereby overriding state sovereign immunity, which generally protects states from being sued by private parties in federal court. **Congress can authorize individual citizen private suits involving monetary damages to compensate for state violations of post-Civil War 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments pursuant to its enforcement powers.**

*EXAM TIP: When an 11th A. question comes up, be sure to carefully read the choices for money damages versus other types of remedies. If money damages and private individuals are involved, the lawsuit will not be permitted unless it involves the 13th, 14th, or 15th Amendments.*

---

## Eleventh Amendment State Sovereign Immunity General Rule

The Eleventh Amendement grants states sovereign immunity, which makes state defendants immune from private suits in any federal or state court or quasi-judicial federal administrative proceeding, unless the state has waived its immunity or Congress has validly abrogated its immunity, or the Ex Parte Young exception applies.

State defendants are immune from federal law claims against states in state courts, unless the state has waived its immunity or Congress has validly abrogated its immunity, or the Ex Parte Young exception applies.

In other words, a private plaintiff can bring (1) a suit in federal court (2) against a state defendant (3) if (a) the state defendant has waived its sovereign immunity (this means the state has explicitly consented to be sued in federal court) or (b) Congress has validly abrogated the state's sovereign immunity (think 13th 14th 15th Amendment).

---

### Ex Parte Young Exception

Private plaintiffs may bring a federal suit against a state official in their official capacity (1) for prospective relief only; (2) on a federal law claim but not on state law claims; (3) unless Congress has expressed an intent to foreclose Ex parte Young suit.

An Ex parte Young suit allows a private party to seek injunctive relief against a state official to stop ongoing violations of federal law. The doctrine provides a way to circumvent the Eleventh Amendment's grant of sovereign immunity to states. Instead of suing the state directly, a plaintiff sues a state official in their official capacity.

An Ex parte Young suit can only be brought to address ongoing violations of federal law. It does not apply to past violations or to claims for monetary damages. The suit must seek prospective relief, typically in the form of an injunction, to stop the state official from continuing to violate federal law.

The state official being sued must have some connection to the enforcement of the allegedly unconstitutional act. The official is named in their official capacity, which means the suit is technically against the office, not the individual.

The court can order the state official to stop the illegal activity. This is because the court views the illegal action as being beyond the official’s authority, thus not protected by the state's sovereign immunity.[^1] [^2]

[^1]:For example, in *Edelman v Jordan* (1974), federal court order requiring state, from the date of the order forward, to obey federal law in administering the state’s public assistance program is prospective relief; the relief is necessary to halt an ongoing violation of federal law and is therefore not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  By contrast, an order requiring the state to refund all the benefits it illegally withheld in the past is retrospective relief; this relief is not necessary to end a continuing violation of federal law, and since the relief would be paid for from the state treasury, it is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.

[^2]:Another example is in *Milliken v. Bradley* (1974), federal court order that Michigan fund a special education program to remedy the current effects of past de jure desegregation in the public schools, held to be prospective relief; current effects of past unconstitutional behavior said to be present constitutional violation; relief is therefore necessary to halt an ongoing violation of federal law, even though it addresses harms caused by past unconstitutional state action.  

---

## Abrogation

Congress may abrogate (remove, override) a state’s State Sovereign Immunity if Congress unequivocally expresses its intent to do so in the text of a statute.  

The normal rules of statutory construction do not apply here; the Court will not consider legislative history or resort to usual tools of statutory analysis, even if such an analysis may reveal a clear congressional intent to override the Eleventh Amendment. The statute does not have to contain magic words (e.g., abrogation, Eleventh Amendment, sovereign immunity, etc.) but it must clearly authorize private suits against a state defendant.

If Congress abrogates a state’s Eleventh Amendment immunity/State Sovereign Immunity, the state may be sued to the extent of the abrogation in the same manner as any other defendant.  Abrogation is not all or nothing.  For instance, Congress may decide to authorize suits only against certain state defendants and/or only for some specified relief.

---

## Waiver

States may waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity, but the Court has set an extremely high threshold for finding waiver, and construes waivers narrowly. As with abrogation, waiver is not all or nothing.  A state that has waived its immunity may be sued only to the extent of the waiver, which may be qualified (limited) to certain forms of relief.  

General waivers of sovereign immunity by a state have been held insufficient to waive Eleventh Amendment immunity; the Supreme Court requires that the state expressly waive its immunity to suit in federal court in order for a federal action to go forward.

The Court will not imply waiver from a state’s participation in a federal program and agreement to obey federal standards, and the Court seems unwilling to find any constructive waiver of state sovereign immunity except where a State’s litigation actions amount to a consent to federal jurisdiction.[^3]

Congress may require states to waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity as a condition of receiving federal funds, and courts will enforce the waiver if Congress has set forth the condition in very clear terms.

[^3]:See *Lapides v. Bd. of Regents* (2002) (implied waiver of State Sovereign Immunity where state agency voluntarily removed a lawsuit from state court to federal court).  

---

# Justiciability

Justiciability asks whether a federal court has the power to hear a particular case.  Justiciability encompasses the doctrines of **standing**, **ripeness** and **mootness** (which examine whether particular parties present a justiciable case or controversy) and the political question doctrine (which examines whether the issue or claims presented are appropriate for judicial resolution).

---

## Standing

To have standing, a plaintiff must have a sufficient stake in the lawsuit to **(1) give rise to an Article III case or controversy** and **(2) satisfy the Supreme Court’s judge-made prudential limitations.** (only one prudential limit remains after *Lexmark*). Congress may override prudential limitations by statute, but may not override Article III case or controversy limits; i.e., Congress may not authorize lawsuits by parties that do not satisfy the Article III case or controversy requirements. **Underlying policies** are **adverse presentation of issues** (courts want cases to be vigorously litigated [this ensures fairness]); **autonomy** (favors placing litigation of rights in the hands of those most affected) and **additional separation of powers and federalism considerations**.[^4] [^5] [^6] [^7]

[^4]:Allen v. Wright (1984):Holding/rule: Citizens do not have standing to sue a federal government agency based on the influence that the agency's determinations might have on third parties. In essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues. Standing doctrine embraces... the general prohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff's complaint fall within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question. The requirement of standing, however, has a core component derived directly from the Constitution. A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief. **Zone of interests test is no longer part of standing analysis after 2014, but relates instead to whether a particular statute confers a right of action on the plaintiff.** Dissents: Justice Brennan wrote a dissenting opinion complaining that the use of separation of powers is a truism. He opined that the injury of the children's opportunities was enough to grant standing to sue. Justice Stevens wrote that the allegation really is that the government is subsidizing white flight, which is sufficient to allow standing – the harm (lack of desegregated schools) was traceable to government conduct. Stevens also asserted that standing has nothing to do with separation of powers.

[^5]:In *Lexmark v. Static Controls* (2014), the Supreme Court held that zone-of-interest is no longer to be considered part of standing analysis, but relates instead to whether a particular statute confers a right of action on the plaintiff.  The zone-of-interests test will appear as part of the standing rule statement in many pre-2014 judicial opinions; those rule statements are no longer correct.  

[^6]: Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife (1992): Issue: Whether the Endangered Species Act of 1973 applied to development projects in Aswan, Egypt and Mahaweli, Sri Lanka funded by the U.S., that could harm endangered species in  affected areas in the U.S.. Rule: Plaintiffs must suffer a concrete, discernible injury - not a conjectural or hypothetical one — to have Article III standing to bring a suit against the U.S. government in federal court. It, in effect, made it more difficult for plaintiffs to challenge the actions of a government agency when the actions don't directly affect them.[2]
Holding: Defenders of Wildlife lacked standing to challenge regulations jointly issued by the U.S. Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce, regarding the geographic area to which a particular section of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 applied.

[^7]:City of Los Angeles v. Lyons (1983): Background: In 1976, Adolph Lyons was stopped by four white LAPD officers for driving with a broken tail light. The unarmed 24-year-old was ordered to leave his vehicle by officers with guns drawn and to spread his legs and put his hands on top of his head. After being frisked, Lyons put his hands down, and an officer put him in a chokehold until he lost consciousness. Lyons woke up lying face down in the road with soiled underwear and blood and dirt in his mouth. The officers gave him a traffic citation and sent him on his way. Seven years later, Lyons sought compensatory damages for the chokehold and declaratory and injunctive relief against the LAPD's chokehold policy. Holding: Lyons failed to allege a sufficiently-plausible threat of future injury to have standing to seek an injunction. Lyons had standing for his damages action since it was retrospective and the injury was concrete and particular. The decision helped to establish the principle that a plaintiff must meet a standing requirement for each form of relief sought.

## Article III case or controversy requirement

1. Injury
2. Causation
3. Redressability

---

## Injury

To have an injury in fact, the plaintiff must show an injury that is (1) concrete and particularized; and (2) actual or imminent.

---

### Concrete

An injury is a concrete injury if it is (1) **tangible** (physical, financial, economic); (2) **intangible injuries may be concrete** if they (a) abridge constitutional rights[^8]; (b) infringe upon other intangible interests previously recognized by the Supreme Court;[^9]; or (c) are historically recognized injuries[^10].

Congress may create statutory rights the invasion of which constitute concrete injury. However, a plaintiff does not automatically satisfy the injury requirement whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right.  Instead, the Court decides whether violation of the statutory interest causes a concrete injury.  

Violation of a statutorily-created procedural right is a concrete injury if the procedural violation increases the risk of real harm to the plaintiff or otherwise affects the plaintiff’s concrete interests. A bare procedural violation that does not impact an actual, concrete interest of the plaintiff does not count as a concrete injury.

[^8]:Intangible injuries that abridge constitutional rights can involve free speech, privacy, and other rights.

[^9]:Intangible interests include environmental, aesthetic, and other interests.

[^10]:Historically recognized injuries include Qui Tam actions or bounty actions, which American and English courts have entertained for centuries. The term qui tam comes from Latin and is derived from the longer phrase qui tam pro domino rege quam pro se ipso in hac parte sequitur, which translates to he who sues in this matter for the king as well as for himself. Legal Definition of qui tam action: an action that is brought by a person on behalf of a government against a party alleged to have violated a statute especially against defrauding the government through false claims and that provides for part of a penalty to go to the person bringing the action.

---

### Particularized

In addition to showing that he suffers a material risk of harm from an actual, concrete injury, the litigant must demonstrate that the injury is particularized; in other words, that the injury affects the litigant in a personal and individual way.

Widely shared harms may be particularized and count as Article III injury if they are concrete and not abstract. For example, a violation of voting rights affecting an entire population would cause each individual voter a particularized injury. Or, for example, imposition of a poll tax in violation of the 24th Amendment would cause each or most citizens a particularized injury.

**Mass Torts** are widespread injuries that qualify as particularized because each person has suffered an individual harm that is distinct from the harm suffered by others.

A **generalized grievance** that involves only abstract harm does not have standing. The ban on generalized grievances is an Article III constitutional limitation on standing. A generalized grievance is defined narrowly as a suit claiming only harm to the litigant and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that does not directly and tangibly benefit the litigant or the public at large.

---

### Actual or Imminent

A **threatened injury** can give rise to standing if it is imminent and not merely speculative or conjectural.

---

## Causation

The injury must be fairly traceable to challenged action.

Multiple links in the causal chain between the challenged action and the injury are not necessarily fatal, but the Court will scrutinize such chains to determine if the causal links are strong enough, especially where the suit seeks an order requiring the government to enforce laws against third parties. The court’s characterization of the injury may affect the length of the causal chain and may alter the causation analysis.

---

## Redressability

An award of relief to the plaintiff must be likely to redress the Article III injury, at least to some extent.  

The litigant must demonstrate standing for each element of relief; the fact that the defendant’s action injured an individual in the past does not necessarily give that individual standing to seek a prospective injunction. *City of Los Angeles v. Lyons*.

---

## Prudential limitations

Prudential standing is satisfied when the injury arguably falls within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute in question.

Prudential limitations are non-constitutional, judge-made limitations on standing. Since these limitations are non-constitutional, they are not binding on Congress. Congress may authorize federal suits by individuals who satisfy Article III case and controversy requirements, irrespective of any prudential limitation.  

At present **there is only one established prudential limitation**. This is **the ban on assertion of third party rights**.[^11]

This is a **general bar against plaintiff assertion of the legal rights of third parties not before the Court**. Justification for this limitation is the idea that the party whose rights are most directly at stake ordinarily should have responsibility and control over litigation of those rights, so courts should only allow the assertion of a third party’s rights by litigants whose interests are **very closely aligned with the right-holder’s**, and who can be trusted to **advocate vigorously** for the third party’s rights. This is also called **Rule against Jus Tertii or Third Party**.

[^11]:In Lexmark v. Static Controls (2014), the Supreme Court suggested (but has not yet held) that prudential limitations ordinarily should not prevent federal adjudication of claims that meet the Article III case and controversy requirements.  The Court’s dictum leaves the status of standing doctrine in some doubt. Reasoning: No generalized grievances: the Court has said that the federal judiciary should decline on prudential grounds to adjudicate generalized grievances shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens. (see also Akins; Richardson; Schlesinger). The ban on generalized grievances is an Article III constitutional limitation on standing, not a prudential limitation. To the extent that the ban on generalized grievances described in earlier cases had a broader scope than defined above, it is unclear whether it survives as a prudential limitation (or may in a later case be deemed part of the Art. Third injury test.)  

---

## Exceptions

**Exception!** A taxpayer can challenge a law believed to violate the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment.[^12]

**Third-party exception:** A litigant lacks standing to assert the rights of third parties not before the court, **unless** (1) the plaintiff has suffered injury; (2) a special relationship exists between the plaintiff and third party because of the connection between the interests of the plaintiff and the constitutional rights of the third party; and (3) the third party is unable or finds it difficult to bring suit on his or her own behalf.

**Organization/Member Exception:** An organization has standing to assert the claims of its members, even  if the association has not suffered any injury itself, if (1) the members would have standing to sue in their own right; (2) the interest asserted is germane to the association’s purpose; and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested would require the individual members to participate in the lawsuit.

Congress can override the generalized grievance concept as a prudential limitation.

[^12]:In other words, Taxpayers have standing to challenge an exercise of Congress’s Article I, sec. 8 taxing and spending power as violative of First Amendment Establishment Clause. *Flast v. Cohen* (1968). See also *Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.* (2007) (taxpayers have no standing to challenge executive branch expenditures as violative of the Establishment Clause.)  

---

### Exceptions to exceptions

congressional override. Plaintiff must always meet Article III requirements.

**Where enforcement of the challenged restriction against the litigant would result indirectly in the violation of third parties’ rights.** For example, enforcement of the alcohol sales restriction against the Plaintiff bar owner in *Craig v. Boren* would result indirectly in the violation of the equal protection rights of the 18-20 year old men; or enforcement of criminal statutes prohibiting distributing contraceptives against the Plaintiff medical providers in Griswold would result in violation of their patients’ constitutional privacy and reproductive rights.

**Where the challenged statute, regulation, etc. would preclude or otherwise adversely affect a relationship between the litigant and the persons whose rights are violated.**  For example, the relationship between parochial schools and parents in Pierce v. Society of Sisters;  poState Sovereign Immunitybly the vendor-vendee relationship in Craig, or doctor-patient relationship in Griswold. This overlaps with the exception where enforcement would result indirectly in the violation of third party rights.

**The overriding inquiry in assessing the applicability of exceptions is whether the plaintiff will vigorously advocate the rights of the third party.** If the court concludes that the litigant will not vigorously advocate for the rights of the third party or may have different interests from the third party, it will deny standing. This can happen where there is a close relationship between the litigant and the third party who possesses the right, and there is a hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his or her own interests.		 

---

## Ripeness

An issue of ripeness arises where plaintiff’s injury has yet to occur and may be contingent on future events that may or may not come to pass.  

Note the large overlap with standing analysis, which asks whether a threatened injury is imminent enough to satisfy the Art. Third injury requirement.  The Supreme Court has recognized that in some cases the standing inquiry is the same as the ripeness inquiry.[^13]

The classic case raising a ripeness question is one in which a plaintiff challenges a statutory or regulatory provision before it is actually enforced against that plaintiff.  This is known as an anticipatory suit or a pre-enforcement challenge.

The **modern ripeness test** appeared in *Abbott Labs v. Gardener* (1967).[^14]

To determine whether a case is ripe, the court balances fitness with hardship.

**Fitness** is whether a claim is fit for judicial review to the extent that it raises purely legal questions such as facial challenges to a regulation's or statute’s validity. If a claim raises purely legal questions, it is more likely to be found fit for judicial review because there is little or no benefit to waiting for additional facts to develop. If, however, the resolution of the claim seems to turn on factual circumstances that have not fully emerged at the time review is sought, it may be deemed unfit for judicial review.

**Hardship** is whether delaying adjudication will result in hardship to a party. The typical instance of hardship is where denying pre-enforcement review will put a party to the choice of risking significant sanctions in order to challenge the allegedly illegal government restriction, or suffering an irremediable deprivation by accepting the restriction.[^15]

**Probability of Actual Harm** is another consideration. The court will always consider the probability that the predicted harm will actually occur, either in its fitness analysis, the hardship analysis or as an independent factor.  

[^13]:See *Susan B Anthony List v. Driehaus* (2014) where the Court hinted in dictum that once a plaintiff satisfies the Article III requirement of imminent injury, ripeness doctrine poses no further barrier to justiciability.

[^14]:See *Abbott Labs v. Gardener* (1967). Abbott was a pre-enforcement challenge to FDA regulations that would have required the plaintiff drug company to re-label its pharmaceutical products at substantial expense.  The drug company sought a judicial declaration of the regulations’ invalidity before the FDA sought to enforce the regulations against the company.  Absent judicial intervention at this pre-enforcement stage, the plaintiff would be put to the choice of incurring significant expense (in order to abide by the regulations) or intentionally disobeying the regulations at the risk of incurring civil or criminal penalties (in order to have an opportunity to challenge the regulations in court).  The Supreme Court was apparently moved by the drug company’s dilemma and held that the case was ripe.  [Compare the Court’s treatment of the parallel (perhaps sharper) dilemma confronting the workers in the Longshoremen’s’ case and the immigrants in Catholic Social Services.]

[^15]:Abbott is an example of this, as is the Longshoremen’s case and the various cases in which doctors have sought pre-enforcement review of anti-abortion statutes.

---

## Mootness

When the case is no longer a live case or controversy because of subsequent events, it is moot. The case and controversy requirements of Article III must be met at every stage of the litigation. If a case becomes moot while on appeal, the appellate court is generally required to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.

Events that could render a claim moot could be if the legislature changed or repealed the challenged law; or the plaintiff’s circumstances could change (for example, 18-20 year old male plaintiffs reach 21st birthdays in suit where age was a material fact).

A claim for money damages would normally survive the changed circumstance because suit seeks compensation for harm or injury that has already occurred.

---

### Exceptions to Mootness

An exception to the mootness doctrine is **disputes that are capable of repetition yet evading review**. To determine whether a dispute falls into this category, courts do a two part test. (1) The dispute or challenged conduct must by its nature be too short in duration to be fully litigated through trial and appeal (hence evading review); and (2) there must be reasonable expectation that dispute will recur (hence capable of repetition).  Normally the recurrence must involve the same parties, but the Court has recognized exceptions to the same-parties requirement.

Classic examples are a pregnant woman challenges abortion law, but pregnancy is resolved before the case is decided; prospective voters or candidates challenge election procedures, but the election occurs before the case can be litigated to conclusion.  **In the voting and abortion contexts, the Court has not required a showing that the dispute may again embroil the same plaintiff.**

Another exception to the mootness doctrine is **class actions**. As a general rule, a class action survives the mooting of the named plaintiff's claim.[^16] For a class action to survive mooting, the named plaintiff’s claim must be live at the time the suit is filed and class certification is requested, and the claims of the class members must continue to satisfy the case and controversy requirements.

Another exception to the mootness doctrine is **defendants' voluntary cessation of challenged conduct**. This does not normally render the case moot so long as the defendant is free to return to his old ways. **A case becomes moot as a result of defendants' voluntary cessation of challenged conduct only if the defendant proves that there is no reasonable likelihood of the conduct recurring.**[^17][^18]

*EXAM TIP: If the correct answer is “ripeness" or "mootness,” then the question will most likely deal with a lawsuit remedy requesting declaratory judgment.*

[^16]:For example, had the plaintiffs in Craig v. Boren sought certification of a class consisting of all 18-20 year old men wishing to drink beer in Oklahoma, the claims of the class would have continued to present a live case and controversy even after the class representatives’ claims became moot on their 21st birthdays.

[^17]:For example, in response to a lawsuit, a welfare administrator voluntarily suspends the enforcement of a discretionary regulation.  This action does not moot the case.

[^18]:This is an empty footnote.

# Political Questions

Federal courts cannot hear cases involving political questions. A political question is a matter that the Constitution assigned to another branch of government or that is incapable of a judicial answer. The Supreme Court set forth factors to determine if the political question doctrine applies.

Two most important factors are (1) something in the Constitution suggests that ultimate decision-making authority is given to another governmental actor;[^19] and (2) the required decision is political rather than legal in character.[^20]

*EXAM TIP: Foreign affairs is a frequently tested political question topic.*[^21]

[^19]:For example, the Constitution says the Senate shall have the sole power to try impeachments. This is not a matter for the courts.

[^20]:For example, the plaintiff argues they were drawn in a manner to favor one political party over another. The Supreme Court has determined that the issue is not legal but rather a political question.

[^21]:This is why foreign affairs are frequently considered political questions: **Separation of Powers:** The Constitution grants specific powers related to foreign affairs to the executive and legislative branches. For example, the President has the power to negotiate treaties and act as the Commander-in-Chief, while Congress has the power to declare war and regulate commerce with foreign nations. **Lack of Judicial Standards:** Courts often find that there are no judicially manageable standards to resolve questions related to foreign affairs. The issues are typically not suitable for judicial resolution because they require expertise and discretion that the judiciary does not possess. **Respect for Coordinate Branches:** Judicial intervention in foreign affairs could undermine the authority and effectiveness of the executive and legislative branches. The judiciary respects the roles and judgments of these branches in handling international relations.

---

## Abstention

A federal court may abstain or refuse to hear a particular case when the case includes undecided issues of state law.

The abstention doctrine permits a federal court to defer to a state court to resolve issues of state law. If resolved via state law, the constitutional issues disappear. Thus, proper deference is paid to the state court system and harmonious federal-state relations are furthered.

Abstention occurs in two ways. (1) The federal court may abstain **if the meaning of a state law or regulation is unclear**. In this situation, the state court might interpret the statute so as to avoid the constitutional issue. (2) Where **a state court proceeding is going on**, the federal court will abstain from hearing the same matter.

---

### Special Case Rule for the U.S. Supreme Court when Adequate and Independent State Grounds

If a state court decision involves a federal question but the state court judgment can be supported on an **adequate and independent state ground**, the Supreme Court will not take jurisdiction. This is because to do so would be tantamount to rendering an “advisory opinion.”

Applies only to the Supreme Court.

Exception: **If the state court says it was merely copying the federal constitution, the doctrine will not apply because there was no independent state ground and the Supreme Court will hear the case.**

*EXAM TIP: A state law ground will usually be adequate if it invalidates something - a state law or a contract. On the other hand, a state law will usually not be adequate if the law or contract is upheld under both state and federal law.*

---

## Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court

The U.S. Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over cases involving ambassadors, foreign diplomats, and states.

Congress cannot enlarge or restrict the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction.

Appellate jurisdiction exists where the Constitution or a federal law is at issue.

---

## Congress Power over the Courts

**Lower courts:** Constitution grants Congress power to create courts inferior to the Supreme Court and prescribe their powers (i.e., change jurisdiction, eliminate, or create courts).

**Supreme Court:** Unsettled how much power Congress has over the Supreme Court.

Congress cannot take a case from appellate jurisdiction and move it to original jurisdiction (Marbury v. Madison).

### Power of Judicial Review

Power of judicial review is the power of the federal judiciary to review the constitutionality of statutes and other governmental acts, and to declare void any acts it finds to be inconsistent with the Constitution.[^22] [^23] [^24] [^25]

[^22]:Source of Judicial Power is Article III. **Article III, Section 1 vests jurisdiction:** The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. **Article III, Section 2 clause 1 enumerates the types of cases over which federal courts have jurisdiction:** The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; to Controversies between two or more States; between a State and Citizens of another State, between Citizens of different States, between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects. **Article III, Section 2 clause 2 distinguishes original and appellate jurisdiction of Supreme Court:** In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.

[^23]:Marbury v. Madison (1803): Holding/rule: Congress may not enlarge Supreme Court's original jurisdiction beyond that prescribed by Article III. Significance: Right to a remedy. Executive branch officials subject to suit and to direction by the courts regarding what the law is. Supremacy of written constitution. Establishes power of judicial review: Role of Court as interpreter of Constitution. Effect of declaration that statute is inconsistent with Constitution.

[^24]:U.S. v. Carolene Products (1938): Holding/rule: The federal government has the power to prohibit filled milk from being shipped in interstate commerce. Economic regulations are presumptively constitutional under a deferential standard of review known as the rational basis test. **Footnote Four**: The Court will exercise a stricter standard of review when a law appears on its face to violate a provision of the United States Constitution, restricts the political process in a way that could impede the repeal of an undesirable law, or discriminates against discrete and insular minorities. Footnote Four would influence later Supreme Court decisions, and the higher standard of review is now known as strict scrutiny.

[^25]:U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton (1995): Holding/rule: States may not impose qualifications for prospective members of Congress stricter than those specified in the Constitution.

### Countermajoritarian Difficulty

Countermajoritarian difficulty is the idea that an essential tension exists between a system of representative democracy founded on the principle of majority rule, and a power in non-elected, life-tenured federal judges to negate laws enacted by a majority of the people’s representatives. I don't think this will come up on the bar exam.

---

### Separation of Powers

Distribution of powers among the three branches of the national government are guaranteed by Article I, which establishes the National Legislature (Congress); Article II, which sets up the National Executive (President); and Article III, which creates the National Judiciary (U.S. Supreme Court).

---

## Powers of Congress

**Legislative Power:**

For a federal law to be constitutional, Congress must not exceed its powers. Congress has the powers the Constitution gives it and no others. Congress must have the power to pass the law, and the law must not violate a constitutional right.

For analysis, ask (1) of congress has the right to create a law, and (2) even if they had the right, is it constitutional. If not, the law is struck down as unconstitutional.

For a state law to be constitutional, the law must not violate a constitutional right.

*EXAM TIP: Watch out for an answer that says Congress had the power to enact the law under its federal police power or Congress’ power to promote the general welfare.* **These powers do not exist unless discussing the District of Columbia or some other federal territory.**

**Procedure**

1. Congress passes a bill with a majority in both houses.
2. The President then signs the bill or vetoes it.
3. If the bill is vetoed, Congress can override the veto if it gets a vote of two-thirds majority in each house.  

**Sources of Congress's Legislative Power:**

**Enumerated Powers**. To collect taxes and spend money for the general welfare, to borrow money on the credit of the United States, regulate commerce, declare war, and to raise and support the army, navy, and militia.

**Enabling clauses of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments** give Congress the power to enforce those amendments by “appropriate legislation.”

**Necessary and Proper Clause** gives Congress the implied power “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper” to carry out an enumerated power.

*EXAM TIP: The Necessary and Proper Clause as an answer by itself will usually be incorrect. If it’s the Necessary and Proper Clause in conjunction with another power, it is more likely to be a right answer.*

---

## Necessary and Proper Clause

The Necessary and Proper Clause states: "The Congress shall have Power To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof." U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clause 18.

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that congressional action need only bear some rational connection to a goal within Congress's constitutionally delegated authority in order to be upheld under the Necessary and Proper Clause.  

Legislation that rationally advances a goal entrusted by the Constitution to Congress (or to other departments of the national government) is constitutional so long as the legislation does not conflict with an external limitation.[^26]

[^26]:For example, congress passes a law creating a national bank. The Constitution does not expressly give Congress this right. However, the Supreme Court reasons that a national bank will help Congress pay debts, collect taxes, spend money, and regulate commerce. Thus, the clause is justified in conjunction with other enumerated powers.

---

## Commerce Power

The Commerce Clause gives Congress broad power to regulate interstate commerce and restricts states from impairing interstate commerce. [^27] [^28]

[^27]:Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 provides that "[The Congress shall have Power . . . ] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; . . ."

[^28]:Early Supreme Court cases primarily viewed the Commerce Clause as limiting state power rather than as a source of federal power. Of the approximately 1,400 Commerce Clause cases that the Supreme Court heard before 1900, most stemmed from state legislation. As a consequence, the Supreme Court’s early interpretations of the Commerce Clause focused on the meaning of “commerce” while paying less attention to the meaning of “regulate.” During the 1930s, however, the Supreme Court increasingly heard cases on Congress’s power to regulate commerce, with the result that its interstate Commerce Clause jurisprudence evolved markedly during the twentieth century. Legal Information Institute.

---

### Commerce Clause

The Commerce Clause grants Congress the power to (1) regulate the use of the **channels** of interstate commerce; (2) regulate and protect the **instrumentalities** of interstate commerce, or **persons or things** in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come from intrastate activities; and (3) regulate activities that have a **substantial relation** to interstate commerce or that **substantially affect** interstate commerce.

---

### Substantial Effects Test

To determine whether activities have a **substantial relation** to interstate commerce or **substantially affect** interstate commerce, courts ask if the activity is economic or non-economic.

If the regulated activity is **economic**, the court will consider the aggregate impact of economic activity, and ask whether Congress could rationally conclude that the regulated activity, considered in the aggregate nationally, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.  (The answer is invariably yes.)

If the regulated activity is **non-economic**, the court will not consider the aggregate impact of non-economic activity in determining whether Congress may regulate that activity under the substantial effects test.

Congress may regulate non-economic activity under the commerce clause if (1) something from Lopez; (2) if the regulation of non-economic activity is an essential part of a broader regulation of economic activity; (3); through a statute with a jurisdictional element limiting the statute’s application case-by-case to activity having a nexus with interstate commerce. (See the amended Gun Free School Zones Act.)

In determining whether a regulation of non-economic activity is an essential part of a broader regulation of economic activity the court asks whether Congress could rationally conclude that failure to regulate that class of non-economic activity would undercut Congress’s broader regulation of economic activity. (In other words, Congress may consider the cumulative impact of a non-economic activity for purposes of determining whether regulation of that activity is essential to a broader economic regulatory scheme).[^29]

[^29]:In Raich, Congress could consider not only whether failure to regulate the plaintiff’s medical marijuana plants would undercut regulation of the marijuana market – it could consider whether failure to regulate that activity in the aggregate (i.e., all home-grown medical marijuana) would undermine its broader economic regulation.

---

### Cumulative Effect Doctrine

Congress can regulate activities that have a tiny effect on interstate commerce independently, when all such activities are put together, a substantial cumulative effect upon interstate commerce will result.

---

### Limitations on Commerce Clause Power

Congress cannot use commerce clause power to regulate intrastate non-economic activity. For example, possession of a handgun is not an economic activity; violent crime is not an economic activity.

Loansharking is considered an economic activity.

For example, in *U.S. v. Lopez* (1995), the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that made it a crime for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm in a school zone. Since gun possession near schools is neither itself an economic activity nor an activity that substantially affects interstate commerce, and since no jurisdictional element connecting particular gun possession to interstate commerce was expressed in the language of the statute, the Supreme Court held that Congress was acting beyond the limits of the Commerce Clause.

Commerce power cannot overcome eleventh amendment state sovereign immunity. For example, Congress cannot use the commerce power to create a private cause of action for money damages against a state. However, it can bar racial discrimination by private parties in activities connected with interstate commerce, (Atlanta Hotel case) but it **cannot use the Commerce Clause as the basis for barring racial discrimination by a state and allow private parties to sue to enforce that law by seeking money damages**. Instead, Congress should use the 13th, 14th, or 15th Amendments to achieve such a law.

---

### Exception to Limitations on Commerce Clause Power Comprehensive Scheme

Congress may use its commerce clause power to regulate intrastate non-economic activity with a comprehensive scheme.

---

## Taxing Power

Congress has the power to impose and collect taxes in order to pay debts and spend for the general welfare. A congressional act purporting to be a “tax” should be upheld as a valid exercise of the taxing power if (1) it raises revenue (objective test); (2) it was intended to raise revenue even if it doesn’t (subjective test); or (3) Congress has the power to regulate the activity that’s being taxed (regulatory test).

For example, the Supreme Court sustained a tax on coal producers who violated a fair competition law, even though it was clearly designed to be a penalty rather than raise revenue [Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U.S. 381 (1940)].

---

## Spending Power

Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, provides Congress with the power to spend for the general welfare.

For example, Congress can give money to political candidates and state that, in return, they must abide by certain expenditure limits. The Supreme Court sustained this as spending for the general welfare because it would reduce the harmful effect of candidates’ reliance on large private contributions [Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976)].

For example, Congress can spend money to build highways. It can even spend money to build a single bridge in a single state. This is because transportation promotes the general welfare.  

For example, Congress may not spend money to build a vacation home for the Senate majority leader. It would take this sort of self-dealing and corruption to fall outside of the general welfare.  

Congress can use its spending power to get around limits on its regulatory power. It may pass a law offering money to states or individuals in exchange for “x”. Often, “x” is not something that Congress could order the state or individual to do directly.  For example, Congress cannot use its commerce power to regulate public schools. However, it can use its spending power to offer money to the public school systems if they agree to implement standardized testing.  

Congress may place a condition on the receipt of federal funds by a state if (1) the spending serves the general welfare; (2) the condition is unambiguous; (3) the condition is related to the federal program (relatedness); (4) the state is not required to undertake unconstitutional action; and (5) the amount in question is not so much that the state is “coerced” into accepting the funds.

---

## War and Defense Powers

Congress may declare war, raise and support armies, provide and maintain a navy, and organize, arm, discipline, and call forth a militia.

During wartime, Congress has the power to (1) activate the military draft and selective service; (2) initiate wage, price, and rent control of the civilian economy; and (3) exclude civilians from certain restricted areas.

Congress can establish military courts to gain jurisdiction over members of the armed forces, conduct court-martial proceedings, and try enemy combatants.

*EXAM TIP: A question might ask what rights a terrorist has with respect to detention. Both U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens within the United States (or U.S. territories) are entitled to Due Process rights.*

---

## Investigatory Power

Congress has broad **investigatory powers** that may extend to any matter within its legitimate lawmaking functions, including **immigration and naturalization**.

Congress can do things necessary to facilitate an investigation (i.e., cite a witness who fails to appear for contempt), but it cannot override any person’s constitutional rights.

---

# Property Power

Congress has the power to regulate or dispose of federal property.

*EXAM TIP: If dealing with a federal territory and not a state, Congress has a general legislative power and can pass any law it would like.*

---

## Power of Eminent Domain

Congress has the power to take private property for public use (implied power, not expressly granted in the Constitution).

---

## Admiralty and Maritime Power

The Supreme Court has determined that the Necessary and Proper Clause gives Congress complete and plenary power to fix and determine the maritime laws throughout the country.

---

## Bankruptcy Power

Congress has the power to “establish uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.”

---

## Postal Power

Congress may establish Post Offices and Post Roads.

---

## Copyright and Patent Power

Congress may “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries”.

---

## Speech and Debate Clause Immunity

Members of Congress cannot be punished or prosecuted for anything they say during debate on the floor in either house.  

---

# Civil War Amendments

Congress has the power to enforce the 13th Amendment, which bans slavery; the 14th Amendment, which prohibits states from violating due process, equal protection, and privileges and immunities; and the 15th Amendment, which prohibits states from discriminating with respect to race in voting rights.

With respect to the 14th and 15th Amendments, Congress can only regulate states, not private individuals.

When enforcing the 14th and 15th Amendments on state governments, (1) such governments must have engaged in widespread violations of the Amendment; and (2) the legislative remedy must be “congruent and proportional to” the violations.

If Congress passed valid legislation to enforce the 14th or 15th Amendment legislation, recall that sovereign immunity under the 11th Amendment will not apply.

---

## Delegation of Power

Congress can create an executive agency and give the agency some legislative power that will prevail over inconsistent state law.

**Limitation:** Congress can delegate power so long as there is some “intelligible principle” that guides the agency.

---

# Executive Power

The President is the chief executive.

---

### Enforcement of Laws

The President can enforce but not create laws.

---

### Appointment Power

The President appoints “high-level officials” such as Ambassadors and Cabinet members with the advice and consent of the Senate.

Congress can delegate appointment of “inferior” officers (anyone who has a superior) to the President; the judiciary; or the head of an executive department.

---

### Removal Power

**Executive officials:** The President may remove any executive appointee without cause (i.e., an ambassador or cabinet member).

**Executive officials with fixed terms:** The President must have cause to remove executive officers who have fixed terms and officers who perform judicial or quasi-judicial functions (e.g., a member of the Federal Trade Commission).

**Federal judges:** The President cannot remove judges, even for cause. The only way a federal judge may be removed is by impeachment.

**Congressional approval/removal:** Congress cannot require the President to get congressional approval before removing someone; Congress cannot remove an official itself.

---

### Veto Power

**Veto Process:**

1.	Once Congress has passed legislation by a majority vote in each house,
2.	the President must sign the bill for it to become law.
3.	If the President vetoes it, Congress must override the veto.
4.	If the President takes no action within 10 days, it becomes law.

**Pocket Veto:** If the bill is presented to the President less than 10 days before the end of a legislative session, then the President can “pocket veto” it.

**Congressional Override:** Congress has the power to override a veto by a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and House.

**Line-item Veto:** A president cannot cancel particular provisions of new federal legislation. The President has to either accept a bill or veto it as a whole.

*EXAM TIP: Bicameralism and presentment are the only ways in which a bill can become a law. Both the House and Senate vote on, and then pass the bill. It is then presented to the President to sign it into law.*

---

### Pardon Power

The President may grant pardons.

**Limitations:**

President can only issue pardons for federal crimes, not state crimes. For a state crime, the governor can offer clemency.

A pardon cannot undo an impeachment, because it is not a criminal conviction. It cannot restore someone to office.

---

### Executive Privilege

**Absolute Privilege:** The President has an absolute privilege to refuse to disclose information related to national security.

**Presumptively Privileged:** Other confidential communications between the President and advisors are presumptively privileged. The purpose of this is to allow the President to seek candid advice. The presumption is overcome when confidential communications are subpoenaed as evidence in a criminal trial.

*For example, the federal court subpoenaed tapes of Nixon and his advisors and the Supreme Court said this was permissible.*  

---

## Commander-in-Chief

The President is Commander-in-Chief of the military.

---

### Military Powers

Congress has the power to declare war. If Congress has not done so, the President’s powers are limited to using military force in response to a surprise attack upon the US.

If the President and Congress disagree, the President prevails only with respect to battlefield tactical decisions.

---

### Treaty Power

The President has the power to make treaties with the consent of the Senate. The Senate must ratify by a two-thirds vote before it becomes federal law.

**Treaties and Federal law:** Treaties have the same status as federal law and will override earlier federal law if ratified by the Senate. **A new federal law enacted after the treaty will override that treaty.**

**Treaties and State law:** Treaties take precedence over any conflicting state law (regardless of whether the treaty precedes or follows the enactment of the state law).

---

### Executive Agreements

The President has the power to enter into executive agreements with foreign nations.

Executive agreements are the sole responsibility of the President, and do not need to be ratified by the Senate.

**Federal statutes:** Executive agreements do not prevail over federal law.

**State law:** Executive agreements prevail over inconsistent state law.

*For example, the President can use an executive agreement to settle claims U.S. citizens have against a foreign country.*

---

## Congressional Limits on the Executive

If Congress is acting within its constitutional powers, Congress may block the President from acting.

*For example, there is a threat of strike at steel mills during wartime and the President decides to seize these mills despite federal laws stating he cannot do so. Courts have found this to be unconstitutional.*

*For example, President sets up military courts on his own in order to try suspected terrorists, ignoring valid federal law established by Congress. Again, this is unconstitutional and Congress wins. The President could have asked for authority from Congress to set up these military courts, and that would have been okay.*

---

## Impeachment Power

Congress can remove the President, federal judges, and any federal official from office.

The House has the sole power to impeach.

The Senate has the sole power to try impeachments. A two-thirds vote in the Senate is required for conviction.

Impeachment by itself does not carry any penalty beyond removal from office.

Impeachable offenses are treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors.

---

## Appropriations Power

Where Congress by legislative act explicitly directs the President to spend appropriated money, the President has no power to impound (i.e., refuse to spend or delay spending) the authorized funds.

*For example, if Congress does not want any Guantanamo prisoner transferred to the U.S., then it can say no federal funds may be used to transport prisoners to the U.S. This will prevent the President from doing otherwise.*

---

## Presidential Limits on Congress

**Veto:** Every act of Congress must be approved and signed by the President before it can become law; but if the president vetoes the bill, it can become law if passed by a two-thirds vote of each house.

**Pardon Power:** President can pardon anyone convicted under federal law.

---

## Judicial Limits on Congress and the President  

The only thing a court can do is to hold a federal law unconstitutional. Courts cannot enforce the judgments, so they need cooperation from the official whose conduct they believe is unconstitutional. Most often the president will comply.

---

# Nature and Scope of Federal and State Powers

**Federal Government** has the powers granted by the Constitution and no others.

**The States** have police power. They can pass laws without identifying a source of power for doing so. However, there are constitutional limitations on state police powers:

**Exclusive Federal Power** reserves certain enumerated powers exclusively for the federal government;

**Individual Rights** restrict state governments from acting in violation of constitutional provisions; and

**Preemption:** Under the Supremacy Clause, if Congress enacts legislation with the intention of preempting state law, the congressional regulation will control.

---

## Immunity of Federal Government

**Sovereign immunity:** The federal government cannot be sued without its consent.

**Supremacy Clause:** Federal law is supreme over state law.

**Taxation of Federal Government by a State:** The federal government and its agencies and instrumentalities are immune from state taxation and regulation that would interfere with their performance of federal functions.

---

## Immunity of State Governments

**11th Amendment:** Recall that Congress cannot create a private cause of action for money damages against a state unless it is using its enforcement powers under the post-Civil War 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. However, individuals may seek injunctive relief.

A state is immune from federal taxation if the tax is applied to unique state activities or essential governmental functions.

**Anti-Commandeering Doctrine:** The federal government cannot force states to act in their sovereign capacities (i.e., legislate or enforce laws).

*EXAM TIP: The 10th Amendment is frequently a “red herring” wrong answer choice, except when the facts show the federal government “commanding” the states.*

*EXAM TIP: It does not matter if a state is happy to obey the federal government regarding legislation or enforcement of a law. It is still unconstitutional. The Spending Clause can often be used instead to achieve the same result.*

For example, Congress enacts a law regulating the purchase of guns by requiring people who do so to consent to a background check. Congress orders state law officials to enforce the law. This law is unconstitutional.

Another example is Congress enacts a law that requires state legislatures to enact programs to dispose of nuclear waste. This is unconstitutional because Congress is ordering state legislatures to legislate.

Yet another example is Congress enacts a law that prohibits race discrimination in employment. This law applies generally to individuals and doesn’t require the state legislature to enact or refrain from enacting legislation. It is constitutional because Congress has enumerated powers to legislate in this area under the 13th and 14th Amendments.  

An additional example is Congress enacts an anti-gambling statute prohibiting states from repealing their anti-gambling laws. This law is unconstitutional because Congress can neither force nor prohibit state legislatures from acting.

---

# Authority Reserved for the States

There is authority reserved for the states.

---

## Dormant Commerce Clause

States cannot discriminate against out-of-state economic actors.

If a state law discriminates on its face against out-of-state goods or economic actors, the state must show that (1) the regulation serves a compelling interest; and (2) the regulation is necessary to achieve the compelling interest.

*For example, Maine bans importation of out-of-state bait fish to preserve Maine fisheries from the parasites in the bait fish. This passes the strict test above. *

**Rule:** State laws that regulate interstate commerce even-handedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.

*For example, a Detroit smoke abatement ordinance that applies to ships traveling in interstate commerce was upheld as a valid health measure.*

*For example, a state law limiting the length of trucks traveling on state highways or trains rolling through the state is unconstitutional because the regulation unduly burdened interstate commerce, and the state failed to demonstrate any significant safety benefit.*

**Exceptions: **

Congress may affirmatively authorize states to legislate in areas that would violate the Dormant Commerce Clause.

When states act as **market participants**, they may discriminate between in-state and out-of-state businesses.

*For example, New York State enacts legislation saying the police department must buy uniforms from in-state suppliers. This law discriminates on its face; however, this is a market-participant exception.*


The Dormant Commerce Clause applies to state taxes.

---

# State Action versus Private Action

To show that the defendant is a state actor, the plaintiff must show that there is governmental action. Constitutional rights can be violated only by governmental actors, not by private actors with the exception of the 13th Amendment and the specific situations below.

**Two Exceptions:**

**Public-Function Theory (also called Entwinement):** Where a private entity is carrying on activities traditionally performed by the government. This theory is also known as entwinement.

**Significant State Involvement Theory (also called Entanglement):** Where a private party’s action is closely encouraged and supported by the state, the private party’s action can be treated as action by the government. This exception is also known as entanglement.

**13th Amendment** does not have a state action requirement. It applies to private individuals.

---

# Due Process and Incorporation of Portions of the Bill of Rights

*EXAM TIP: Multiple-choice questions on this topic will present themselves in two different forms. The first asks what is the best source for an argument that a particular law is unconstitutional. For this, ask whether the constitutional provision protects persons from actions by the states or from actions by the federal government. The second type of question asks whether a law is constitutional. For this, look to the actual content of the individual rights.*

---

## Constitutional Provision to Rely On

**The Bill of Rights** can be invoked **against the federal government** (the first 10 amendments).

If the federal government is discriminating, the **Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment** should be invoked.

**The Bill of Rights can be invoked against the states using the 14th Amendment Due Process Clause.**

However, there are provisions of the Bill of Rights that **cannot be asserted via the 14th Amendment Due Process Clause**. These are **5th Amendment – right to indictment by grand jury**; and **7th Amendment – right to a jury trial in civil cases. **

For **discrimination by state governments**, usually the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment will apply unless (1) the state is discriminating against out-of-state business interests or corporations. For that, the Due Process Clause (Dormant Commerce Clause) might apply; or (2) the state is discriminating against citizens who have moved from another state. For that, the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment applies.

*EXAM TIP: The Privileges or Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment is frequently a wrong answer.  However, it may be a right answer with regard to the right to travel (e.g., moving from one state to another).*

**The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article 4 prohibits states from discriminating against non-residents** (e.g., a commuter tax that applies to non-residents but not residents of the state).

---

# Due Process Clause

The 5th and 14th Amendments offer two kinds of protection. These are **procedural due process** and **substantive due process**.

---

## Procedural Due Process

Procedural due process protects against governmental deprivation of “life, liberty, or property” without due process of law.

A person is any person. A corporation is a person.

Liberty includes freedom from bodily restraint and physical punishment. Liberty is very broad.

Property is narrower. If the state can take something away from a person for no reason at all, there is no property interest. There are generally property interests in public education; public employment (if fixed-term employment or can be fired only for cause); welfare benefits; and driver’s license.

Life is the life of a person. If a state wants to execute a person, it must provide due process of law.

**Process: **

To deprive someone of life, liberty, or property, the government must give (1) **notice**; and (2) **hearing**. To determine if there was adequate notice and hearing, courts consider (i) the importance of the individual interest protected; (ii) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of this interest through the procedures used; and (iii) the government’s interest in streamlined procedures.

---

## Substantive Due Process

Substantive due process protects substantive rights not specifically referenced by the Constitution’s text.

Substantive rights are rights which are “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty” or “deeply rooted” in our history and tradition.

---

### Rational Basis Review versus Strict Scrutiny

At a minimum, substantive due process requires that all legislation be rationally related to some legitimate government purpose (rational basis review).

However, when a court deems that the substantive right asserted by the plaintiff is a fundamental right, then the court will apply strict scrutiny and require that the legislation be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.

---

### Economic Regulations

**A substantive due process challenge directed at an economic regulation is subject only to rational basis review.**

Under such a review, the burden is on the plaintiff to show either: (1) that the government interest is not legitimate, or (2) if the government’s interest is legitimate, that the legislation is nevertheless not rationally related to promoting it.

In either case, the plaintiff’s burden is difficult to meet and the government action will likely survive review.

Both over-inclusive and under-inclusive laws will satisfy rational basis review.

---

### Fundamental Rights

A substantive due process challenge directed at government action that impinges on a right deemed fundamental is subject to strict scrutiny.

For strict scrutiny review, the burden is on the government to show (1) a compelling government interest and (2) that the legislation is narrowly tailored to achieve the government interest.

Both over-inclusive and under-inclusive laws will likely fail strict scrutiny review.

**Contraceptives**

**Marriage**

**Family Relations :** Government cannot prohibit members of an extended family from living in a single household. State can ban unrelated persons from living together in a single-family residence.

**Private Education:** Parents have a fundamental right to privately educate their children outside the public  school system.

**Possession of Obscene Material:** A person has a right to possess obscene material in the privacy of their home; they do not have a right to buy or sell obscene material. Exception: The state can criminalize even the private possession of child pornography.

**Right to Travel:** 14th Amendment Privileges or Immunities Clause allows citizens to travel freely  from state to state and to set up residency in a new state. The right to international travel is not absolute and may be subject to reasonable restrictions in the name of national security.

**Right to Vote:** Generally, the right to vote comes from the 1st Amendment Right of Association and the 14th Amendment. However, there are more specific amendments regarding the right to vote.

- **15th Amendment:** States cannot discriminate with respect to race and right to vote.
- **19th Amendment:** States cannot discriminate with respect to sex and right to vote.
- **24th Amendment:** No poll taxes.
- **26th Amendment:** Right to vote for all citizens 18 years or older.
- **Level of Scrutiny:** Some voting restrictions are constitutional, while others are not.

**Restrictions that are constitutional:** (1) Reasonable residency and voter registration requirements; (2) reasonable regulation of time and manner of casting votes; (3) denying felons the right to vote.

**Restrictions that are unconstitutional (strict scrutiny applies):** (1) Cannot impose poll tax; (2) cannot require voters at school board elections to own property; (3) cannot count votes using standards that lack uniformity or are too vague.

*A state cannot block you from voting in a presidential election if you are not a member of a political party. The plaintiff will be successful with respect to the general presidential election. With respect to the primary, political parties are sufficiently intertwined with a state that for some things they will be considered state actors. However, to say that their primary is closed to party members is a reasonable restriction and not unconstitutional.*

**Presidential Elections:** The President is not chosen by the overall popular vote. Instead, individual voters select electors as state representatives and they actually choose the President. Anyone who may vote for state legislature can vote for state electors.

---

### No Fundamental Right but Court Created Nuance

**Right to Die:** No right to die via suicide or assisted suicide, but there is a right to refuse medical treatment.

**Same-Sex Intimacy:** Same-sex intimacy is not considered a fundamental right, but it is unconstitutional to  criminalize such behavior. The Court applied a rational basis review, but because the state lost, which is virtually unheard of, the court seemed to apply rational basis with “teeth.”

---

## Fifth Amendment Takings Clause

The federal government cannot take private property for public use without just compensation. This prohibition applies to the states as well through the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.

Public use is if there is a public purpose (easy standard to meet).

There are four kinds of takings.

**Direct government appropriation:** Where the government actually takes someone’s property.

**Regulatory taking:** Where the government doesn’t take property, but imposes a regulatory requirement that is so onerous as to effectively amount to a taking. A regulatory requirement amounts to a taking if (1) the regulation requires the property owner to suffer some permanent physical invasion[^30]; or the regulation deprives the property owner of all economically beneficial use to the property[^31]. The government will balance the economic versus physical impact of the regulation on the property owner, as well as the duration and character of the government action. [^32]

For example, a state law that permits only residential development on a property owner's land is a regulatory taking where the government doesn't outright take ownership of the property, but instead, imposes a regulatory requirement that is so onerous as to effectively amount to a taking.

**Temporary restrictions** do not permanently deprive the owner of all economically beneficial uses of his land. A court will look at both the dimensions of a property interest and the term of years.

**Conditional permits:** A condition on the grant of a permit for land development is permissible if (1) there is a logical nexus between the condition and the governmental purposes; and (2) there is rough proportionality between the impact on the proposed development and the governmental objectives served by the condition.

[^30]: For example, a state law requires landlords to permit cable companies to install cable lines through apartment buildings.

[^31]: For example, a state law was passed permitting only residential development on the property owner’s land. This does not deprive the property owner of all economically beneficial use and is not a taking. Another example is a state disallows any development on land owned by an individual. This is a taking.

[^32]: For example, a 32-month moratorium on development in an area was not considered a taking.

---

# Equal Protection

**Constitutional Basis:** For the states, 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause; for the federal government, 5th Amendment Due Process Clause.

Equal protection requires the government to justify when it discriminates.

*EXAM TIP: For an equal protection question, identify: (1) the type of discrimination; (2) against whom; and (3) identify and/or apply the level of scrutiny attached to that discrimination against that particular group.*

---

## Standards of Review

| Rational Basis | Intermediate Scrutiny | Strict Scrutiny |
| ---------------------------- |---------------------------- |---------------------------- |
| rationally related to a legitimate government interest | substantially related to an important government interest | narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest |

---

### Rational Basis

**Rational basis** is the level of review for **disparate impact**. Disparate impact, by itself, is not discrimination.

For example, if a test is neutral on its face, but one race scores higher than the other, there is no discrimination. The burden is on the plaintiff to show that the measure being challenged is not rationally related to any legitimate governmental interest (plaintiff will almost always lose).

However, if the purpose of the measure being challenged was **intended** to have a racially disproportionate effect, then it is intentional discrimination and will face strict scrutiny.

If a neutral standard is being applied in a discriminatory way, it will face strict scrutiny.

Rational basis review applies to all classifications not falling under strict or intermediate scrutiny, such as classifications based on age, disability, and alienage if done by Congress. The government generally prevails when rational basis review is applied.

**Exception:** Classifications based on sexual orientation that appear to discriminate based on that classification are unconstitutional because the legislation lacked a legitimate government purpose. In each case, the legislation failed to even pass the low-level scrutiny of rational basis review. Remember, that the court seems to apply rational basis review “with teeth” to sexual orientation cases.

---

### Intermediate scrutiny

The government (the defendant) must show that the measure being challenged is substantially related to an important government interest.

Intermediate scrutiny applies to government discrimination regarding gender and illegitimacy.

---

### Strict scrutiny

The government must prove that the measure being challenged serves a compelling government interest and is strictly tailored to furthering that interest.

The government usually fails to prove its burden under strict scrutiny.

---

### Suspect Classifications

Do equal protection analysis based on classification of group.

| Rational Basis | Intermediate Scrutiny | Strict Scrutiny |
| ---------------------------- |---------------------------- |---------------------------- |
| rationally related to a legitimate government interest | substantially related to an important government interest | narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest |
| Non-suspect classification | Quasi-suspect classification | Suspect classification |
| Age, alienage (federal), disability, sexual orientation (rational basis with teeth), undocumented immigrant children (rational basis with teeth), wealth, private sexual activities, economic rights, everything else | Gender, illegitimacy | Alienage (state), domestic travel, national origin, race, voting |

**Strict Scrutiny:** Applies to classifications based on race, alienage, and national origin. Such laws will be presumptively invalid, absent a showing by the state that the measure is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest.

**Racial discrimination:** State laws prohibiting interracial marriages or interracial cohabitation are unconstitutional. They facially discriminate on the basis of race.

**De jure segregation:** Laws that deliberately segregate on the basis of race. This will face strict scrutiny and almost always be found unconstitutional.

**De facto segregation:** Segregation in fact but not by operation of law. This isn’t discrimination, as there’s no state action.

**School segregation:** Various plans to hinder desegregation have been deemed unconstitutional, including the closing of all public schools. School boards have an affirmative duty to eliminate intentional racial segregation of schools. **Court-ordered busing is constitutional where it is implemented to remedy past discrimination in a particular school system, some sort of de jure segregation.**

**Overt classifications may pass strict scrutiny**, for example, where police are separating a crowd by race in the middle of a riot.

**Alienage Discrimination by States: **

**Resident Noncitizens:** When states discriminate against resident noncitizens, apply strict scrutiny.

**Public-Function Exception:** Some jobs or activities may be withheld from resident noncitizens, including Police officers; Governmental officials; and Public school teachers.

**Undocumented Immigrants:** Rational basis review applies to discrimination against undocumented immigrants. However, states cannot enact their own immigration policy. That is reserved for the federal government.

**Undocumented Immigrant Children:** The Court determined that undocumented immigrant children have a right to free public elementary and secondary education. The Court used a stringent version of the rational basis scrutiny test (rational basis review “with teeth”) and held that the discrimination against the children “can hardly be considered rational unless it furthers some substantial goal of the state.”

---

### Intermediate Scrutiny

**Illegitimacy:** Laws that treat people differently based on whether their parents were married.

For example, state laws that deny welfare benefits to illegitimate children are unconstitutional. State laws that deny illegitimate children from sharing equally with other children in workers’ compensation death benefits are unconstitutional.

*EXAM TIP: If there is a question with discrimination based on illegitimacy on the bar exam, it will probably be unconstitutional. This sort of discrimination serves no important governmental interest.*  


**Gender Discrimination:** Laws that treat men and women differently must meet intermediate scrutiny.

**Example of constitutional laws: **

The Court upheld the registration of males but not females for draft by the military because Congress, pursuant to its military powers, had determined that this was necessary to further important government interests.

State statutory rape laws may set the age of consent higher for females than for males. This is based on an actual biological basis. Females can become pregnant and there is a state interest in preventing teen pregnancy.

*EXAM TIP: If a question involves discrimination that is motivated or reinforced by traditional stereotypes about appropriate gender roles, it will most likely be unconstitutional.*   

**Affirmative Action – Gender:** Gender based affirmative action need only pass intermediate scrutiny.

For example, Social Security statutes and tax exemptions that entitle women to greater benefits were upheld.

Another example is U.S. navy discharge procedure that required male officers, twice denied promotion to be automatically discharged, but not female officers, was upheld because in the past because men had been afforded greater promotional opportunities than women.

**General rule:** Benign discrimination in favor of women gets upheld to make up for past discrimination either by the person who is offering the remedial program or to make up for societal discrimination.

---

## Privileges and Immunities under Fourteenth Amendment

The Fourteenth Amendment provides that “no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.”
This has a very limited application and primarily includes the right to travel across state lines and establish residence in a new state; petition Congress; vote for federal offices; assemble; and enter public lands. **Corporations are not protected by the 14th Amendment Privileges and immunities clause. **

---

## Privileges and Immunities under Article IV Section 2

Sometimes referred to as the Comity Clause, Article IV, Section 2 provides: “The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.”

Article IV, Section 2 prohibits states from discriminating against non-residents (based upon the fact that they do not reside in the state) with respect to rights and activities that are fundamental to the national union.

Invalid forms of non-resident discrimination include state statutes that require non-residents to pay a higher fee for commercial licenses; commuter taxes that apply to non-residents, but not to residents; or state laws requiring employers to give hiring preference to state residents.

Types of discrimination that have been upheld are state statute requiring non-residents to pay higher fees for recreational licenses than residents; or when the purpose of discrimination is to preserve natural, state-owned resources.

**Test:** The state can discriminate if it is substantially related to a substantial state interest.

Corporations cannot assert these rights, as a corporation is not a citizen. A corporation can protect itself from such discrimination via the Dormant Commerce  Clause.

For example, New York cannot impose commuter tax only on non-state residents even if it claims that New York residents pay through a state income tax not imposed on out-of-state residents because New York state is imposing a burden on out-of-state residents for crossing state lines.   

---

# Retroactive Legislation

There is retroactive legislation.

---

## The Contract Clause

Article I, Section 10 states that “No state shall...pass any…Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.”

The Contract Clause applies only to state legislation, and not to state court decisions or to the federal government. When determining whether a contract may be modified, courts will consider (1) the severity of the impairment; and (2) the importance of the public interest to be served. [^33]

[^33]:For example, a state law imposing a moratorium on mortgage foreclosures during the depression was upheld. Another example is a state attempted to use transit authority funds to subsidize public transportation in violation of a previous statutory covenant to private bondholders. This was held unconstitutional. Yet another example is the Court invalidated state pension reform legislation, which increased the obligation of companies under preexisting pension plans.

---

## Ex Post Facto Laws

There are two ex post facto clauses in the Constitution that prevent both the state and federal governments from passing retroactive criminal laws.

Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 provides: “No...ex post facto Law shall be passed”; and Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 provides: “No State shall pass any…ex post facto Law.”

In general, a statute violates the ex post facto clause if it (1) makes criminal an act that was not a crime when committed; (2) prescribes greater punishment for a crime after its commission; (3) decreases the amount of evidence required for conviction; or (4) extends the statute of limitations for a crime as to which the previously applicable statute of limitations has already expired.

---

## Bills of Attainder

Two provisions prevent both federal and state legislatures from passing bills of attainder. A bill of attainder is a legislative act that inflicts punishment without a judicial trial upon named individuals or an easily ascertainable group for past conduct.

Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 states: “No bill of attainder…shall be passed”; and Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 provides: “No state shall pass any Bill of Attainder.” [^34]

Ex post facto laws will not single out an individual or a group whereas bills of attainder do. Bills of attainder also will not involve a trial.

[^34]: For example, Congress passes a law making it a crime for a member of the Communist Party to act as an officer of a labor union. This is the equivalent of legislative punishment, and hence a bill of attainder. Another example is Congress passes a law stating that Nixon must turn over various presidential papers and tape recordings. This does not constitute a bill of attainder, because the act was non-punitive.

---

# First Amendment

There are various First Amendment freedoms.

---

## Freedom of Religion and Separation of Church and State

The 1st Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”

This is the establishment clause. It applies to both the federal government and the states through the 14th Amendment.

Where a law prefers one religion or religious sect over others, strict scrutiny applies.

The Supreme Court has held that the appropriate test for a potential Establishment Clause claim is to interpret the Establishment Clause using an originalist approach, examining historical practices and understandings, and including an examination of the potential for coercion *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District*, 142 S. Ct. 2407 (2022).

---

### Religious Activities Conducted at Public Schools

Generally, religious activities conducted in public schools violate the Establishment Clause because their primary purpose is to promote religion.

Activities at public schools that violate the Establishment Clause are (1) prayer and bible reading in public schools; and (2) a period of silence “for meditation or voluntary prayer.” However, a truly neutral moment of silence would likely be found constitutional, because it shows no religious preference.

Posting of just the Ten Commandments on the walls of classrooms in a public school violates the Establishment Clause.

Having a Rabbi or other cleric to conduct non-denominational prayer as part of a graduation ceremony at a public school violates the Establishment Clause.

**Exception:** A state legislature may employ a chaplain to conduct an opening day prayer.

An activity that does not violate the Establishment Clause is Religious club holding its meetings in a public school.

**Public School Curriculum:** The state cannot put religious classes in public schools (i.e., anti-evolution laws).

**Other Government Endorsement of Religion:**
Displays that celebrate the holiday season without favoring one religion over another are generally upheld as constitutional.

A city may grant a license permitting a private group to put up a cross in a city park near a statehouse.

A city may not deny a request to ceremonially fly a religious flag if it accepts all secular requests for ceremonial flag flying.

Placement of the Ten Commandments on the walls of courthouses is unconstitutional (no secular purpose).

However, posting the Ten Commandments as a monument along with many other monuments surrounding the State Capitol will not violate the Establishment Clause. Religion can be included as one of many elements, but it cannot be the sole focus.

Sunday closing laws for the purpose of rest have been held constitutional because it is a secular purpose.

Delegation of authority to religious organizations is unconstitutional.

---

### Tax Deductions for Religious Institutions

The Supreme Court has upheld the validity of a property tax exemption for religious institutions, if treated the same as other non-profits.

A tax exemption from sales and use taxes available only for the sale of religious magazines and books violates the Establishment Clause as an endorsement of religion.

---

### Government Aid to Religious Schools

Providing bus fare for both public and private (including some religious) schools has been found to be constitutional.

States can provide money to both public and private schools for secular textbooks; standardized secular exams; school lunches; library media materials and computers; and interpreters for deaf students.

States cannot give money to be used directly for religious instruction; or to religious secondary schools – even for the salaries of teachers of secular subjects because of the risk of “excessive government entanglement.” This is not true at the university level. The states can fund the salaries of secular teachers because it is assumed that their professional norms will prevent them from engaging in religious indoctrination.

If a tax deduction is given to all parents based on actual expenditures for children attending any public, private, or religious school, it will be upheld.

A voucher program that allows parents to send their children to parochial or religious schools with state aid instead of to failed public schools is allowed because aid is neutral with respect to religion to a broad class of citizens, defined without reference to religion, and parents direct aid to religious schools as a result of their own independent and private choice.

**A voucher program that provides parents a choice as to where they send their children to school cannot exclude religious schools from this voucher program.**

---

### Providing Public Services through Religious Institutions

If the government has a sex education program where it gives funding to both secular and religious organizations to carry out the program, it is constitutional.

---

## Free Exercise Clause

A person’s religious beliefs are absolutely protected. The government may not punish an individual by denying benefits or imposing burdens based on religious belief.

The government may not determine the truth or falsity of a person’s religious beliefs, but it may determine a person’s sincerity in his or her claim of religious belief.

**Rule:** Where an individual’s conduct is motivated by their religious beliefs, the state may regulate or prohibit the activity if the regulation is “neutral in respect to religion and is of general applicability.”

Through courts’ application of this rule, a state law outlawing polygamy was upheld; the Court struck down a free exercise challenge by a Jewish Air Force doctor who violated uniform dress requirements by wearing a yarmulke while on duty; the Social Security tax applied to an Amish employer was held constitutional, even though his religious beliefs prohibited him from making payments and from receiving benefits.

**Exceptions:**

The state cannot deny unemployment compensation benefits to a person whose religious faith commands the observance of Saturday as the Sabbath.

The state can’t require Amish children to attend high school.

*A religious claim such as my son has to go to school with a very large and sharp knife-like cross around his neck loses unless plaintiff can show that the school board was trying to burden religion.

---

# Freedom of Speech

The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.”

The First Amendment applies to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The First Amendment does not apply to private parties. A newspaper cannot be enjoined to run an ad.

Under the First Amendment, the government may not interfere with or distort the marketplace of ideas, especially with respect to political speech.

Strict scrutiny applies when the government engages in content-based discrimination.

For example, a New York ordinance prohibiting political speech in the park was held unconstitutional as a content-based regulation of political speech that could not be justified by proof of a compelling governmental interest served by narrowly tailored means. Another example is the government cannot prohibit desecration of the American flag. The government cannot silence this message of political protest. Another example is the government cannot prohibit speech critical of foreign governments near embassies. This is viewpoint-based discrimination and is unconstitutional.

A common pattern is (1) content-based regulation, (2) strict scrutiny, (3) unconstitutional.

There are five exceptions.

1.	Child pornography including deep fake child pornography, because it survived strict scrutiny and other speech that survives strict scrutiny
2.	Unprotected or low-value speech
3.	Government as speaker
4.	Content-neutral conduct regulation
5.	Content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation.

---

### Unprotected or Low Value Speech

**A  regulation that relates to unprotected speech must pass the rational basis test.**

Unprotected speech includes:

**Speech that advocates violence or unlawful action**. The test is whether such advocacy is (1) directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action, and (2) is likely to incite or produce such action. If both elements are satisfied the speech is not protected.

**Fighting words** are words likely to incite an ordinary citizen to commit acts of immediate physical retaliation may be punished. The speech must be more than annoying or offensive; it has to be a direct personal insult. “Fighting words” statutes are subject to facial invalidity if the conduct proscribed is vague (e.g., a law prohibiting “opprobrious words”) or overbroad. “Fighting words” statutes designed to punish certain viewpoints are unconstitutional.

**Hostile audience speech:** Speech which elicits an immediate violent response against the speaker by an audience may be grounds for prosecution. The police, however, must make reasonable efforts to protect the speaker, to guard against a “heckler’s veto” of unpopular speech.

**Obscene speech:** Speech is considered obscene if (1) the average person, applying local contemporary community standards, would find the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest (prurient means intended to arouse or appeal to sexual desires); (2) the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct that is specifically defined by state law; and (3) the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value (national standard).

**Defamatory speech:** Constitutional restrictions apply to defamatory speech where the plaintiff is either a public official or public figure, or where the defamatory statement involves a matter of public concern.

**Private person, matter of private concern:** plaintiff does not need to prove actual malice. The plaintiff need only show negligence in order to recover according to common law defamation principles.

**Private person, matter of public concern:** plaintiff must prove negligence about the truth or falsity of the statement (no malice required).

**Public official/figure, matter of public or private concern:** plaintiff must prove the state law requirements of defamation and “actual malice.” Actual malice is knowledge of the falsity or reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the statement.

**Private person suing media for false-light invasion of privacy concerning matter of public interest:** plaintiff must prove actual malice. This standard is higher than in cases when a private plaintiff sues for defamation over matters of public interest. In the latter cases, the plaintiff need only prove negligence.

**Rule:** A newspaper or broadcaster cannot be held liable for publishing truthful information obtained from the public record. Any newsworthy and true information is also protected.

---

### Low-Value Speech aka Quasi Protected Speech

**Commercial speech** is protected by the 1st Amendment if it is not false or deceptive and does not relate to unlawful activity. If commercial speech satisfies these requirements, government regulation of the speech must satisfy the three-part test.

The government may regulate commercial speech if the commercial speech (1) serves a substantial governmental interest; (2) directly advances the substantial governmental interest; and (3) is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.

For example, a state can discipline lawyers for in-person solicitation of clients for personal gain because of the potential for overreaching; or prohibit commercial billboards.

A state cannot ban advertisement of drug prices; prohibit attorneys from advertising legal services; nor ban all advertising for legal products.

---

### Sexual or indecent speech

Indecent speech is fully protected but can be regulated on the basis of secondary effects. Secondary-effects regulations must serve a substantial government interest and leave open reasonable alternative channels of communication. [^35]

[^35]:For example, a city can impose zoning restrictions on adult theaters, even if it restricts the theaters from 95% of the city. Another example is a ban on public nudity, including nude dancing in adult entertainment establishments, was held constitutional. Another example is the government cannot ban the registration of immoral or scandalous trademarks because the law cannot favor certain viewpoints.

---

### Government as Speaker

When the government itself is the speaker, it is entitled to promote its own policies and viewpoints. The government may fund certain programs or initiatives and choose not to fund others based on its own policy preferences.

Examples of government speech are government-funded advertising campaigns; government-issued publications; speech by government employees acting in their official capacities, such as public school teachers or government lawyers.

**Limits on Government Speech:** While the government has broad discretion as a speaker, it cannot violate constitutional rights. For example, it cannot compel individuals to express certain views or retaliate against employees for their private speech.
For example, in *Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans* (2015), the Supreme Court held that Texas could reject specialty license plates featuring the Confederate flag because license plates are a form of government speech, and the government can control its own messages.

---

### Conduct Regulation

Laws that regulate conduct and create an incidental burden on speech are allowable if (1) the regulation furthers an important or substantial government interest that is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and (2) the incidental restriction on speech is no greater than is necessary to further that interest.

*For example, it is constitutional for the government to restrict people from burning their draft cards.*

---

### Time Place Manner

The government may place reasonable restraints on the time, place, and manner of speech in public areas, such as streets, sidewalks, and parks (places historically associated with expressive conduct).

**Three-part test for public forums:**

A regulation placing restraints on the time, place, and manner of speech must (1) be content-neutral as to both subject matter and viewpoint (i.e., the regulation cannot prefer some messages over others); (2) **be narrowly tailored to serve an important government interest**; and (3) leave open alternative channels of communication.

For example, the government can require large gatherings to get a permit to use public property (the criteria to receive a permit must be defined and content-neutral). The government can also restrict the volume and hours of amplifiers.

The government cannot require parades or marches to pay for police protection. The government cannot enact a complete ban on door-to-door solicitation.

**Non-public forums:** Speech-related activities at non-public forums, such as military bases, jails, government workplaces, and mailboxes can be regulated by viewpoint-neutral regulations. **The regulation must be reasonably related to a legitimate government purpose.**

For example, the government can prohibit demonstrations on jailhouse grounds; close military bases to political speeches and leaflet distribution; regulate speech in government workplaces; sell commercial advertising on a city bus but refuse to sell such space for political advertising.

The government cannot deny use of public school facilities to religious groups if other public and private groups are allowed similar access.

---

### Public Employment

An individual cannot be denied public employment based upon membership in a political organization, unless the position is a high-level policy-making position.

A public defender is not a high-level policy-making position.

An individual may be denied public employment based on political association if the individual (1) is an active member of a subversive organization; (2) has knowledge of the illegal aims of the organization; and (3) has a specific intent to further those illegal aims.

Public employees can be required to take an oath to support the Constitution and to oppose the overthrow of the government by illegal means.

The government cannot require (1) public employees to swear not to aid, advise or influence the Communist Party; (2) employees to swear to inspire reverence for the flag; or (3) school children to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.

Public employees may be disciplined or fired for speech if (1) speech is not a matter of public concern; or (2) speech is potentially disruptive to the workplace (even if it is a matter of public concern).

---

### School Children

Public school children can be disciplined for speech that is potentially disruptive.

---

### Incarcerated People

Incarcerated People’s speech may be restricted by a regulation that is rationally related to a legitimate penological objective.

---

### Prior Restraint

The government cannot suppress or restrain speech in advance of its publication or utterance. Strong presumption that prior restraints are illegal.

Exceptions include classified military information.

A government agency can require prepublication review of writings related to employment of past or present employees where such a review is necessary to protect national security.

A method the government frequently uses for regulating the time, place, and manner of speech is to require a license or permit for such activities as a parade, demonstration, or rally.

A licensing statute that is valid on its face must be obeyed and a permit denial cannot be ignored, even if the statute is applied unconstitutionally.

Where a statute is facially void (i.e., gives the licensing officials unrestricted discretion), a speaker need not even apply for a permit. In this case, one may exercise their First Amendment rights on the public property without a permit.

---

### Pretrial Publicity Restraining Order

The court considers three factors in determining if a restraining order against pretrial publicity is appropriate. These factors are (1) the nature and extent of the pretrial publicity; (2) the availability of other measures to mitigate the effects of pretrial publicity; and (3) the likely effectiveness of the restraining order.

Pretrial gag orders are usually unconstitutional if there are alternative means to prevent pollution of the jury pool such as (1) careful voir dire of jury; (2) change of venue; or (3) postponement of the trial.

Injunctions must be obeyed or appealed; they cannot be ignored even if erroneous.

---

### Overly Broad

When a state has the power to regulate an area dealing with free speech, it must do so in a way that is narrow and specific, and not overly broad so as to have a “chilling effect” upon protected speech.

Overbreadth is an exception to third-party standing.

---

### Vagueness

The “vagueness” doctrine is closely related to the “overbreadth” doctrine. Governmental regulations must be drawn “with narrow specificity” and not be vague.

Examples of statutes found to be “void for vagueness” are a statute making it a crime to treat the flag contemptuously; or a state law that denies a government job to people who are subversive.

---

### Press

The press has no greater freedom to speak than an ordinary member of the public.

A newsperson has no 1st Amendment right to refuse to testify before a grand jury.

In general, radio and television broadcasting can be more closely regulated than the print media or a private individual because they have a license from the government and are exercising a privilege the government gives them.

The Court has held that cable television receives 1st Amendment protection somewhere between that of broadcast TV and newspapers and citizens.

Government can ban offensive sexual content and speech on broadcast television.

Where cable TV operators are subjected to content-neutral regulations, intermediate scrutiny  is applied.

On the other hand, where content-specific regulation is imposed, the Court has yet to select a standard of review; however, the Court allows cable TV operators the right to ban “indecent” programming on channels that are leased outright to unaffiliated third parties (but not to public access channels).
