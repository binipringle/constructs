# Federal Judicial Power

Basic Concepts are federalism, separation of powers, power of judicial review and countermajoritarian difficulty.

---

### Federalism

Federalism is a system of "dual sovereignty" by which the states operate under a national or "federal" government but still retain certain independent powers and sovereign attributes.

A major question in US constitutional law has been whether and to what extent the judiciary should define and enforce federalism-based limits (or “states' rights” limits) on the national government.

---

### Separation of Powers

Distribution of powers among the three branches of the national government are guaranteed by Article I, which establishes the National Legislature (Congress); Article II, which sets up the National Executive (President); and Article III, which creates the National Judiciary (U.S. Supreme Court). [^1]

[^1]:When the modern Court speaks of "separation of powers" as justification for declining to adjudicate cases, it has concluded that the broad availability of federal courts as a means for enforcing legal norms against other branches of the national government would expand the role and power of the judiciary beyond constitutional boundaries and would inappropriately intrude into the spheres of the political departments of government.

---

### Power of Judicial Review

Power of judicial review is the power of the federal judiciary to review the constitutionality of statutes and other governmental acts, and to declare void any acts it finds to be inconsistent with the Constitution.[^2] [^3] [^4]

[^2]:Marbury v. Madison (1803): Holding/rule: Congress may not enlarge Supreme Court's original jurisdiction beyond that prescribed by Article III. Significance: Right to a remedy. Executive branch officials subject to suit and to direction by the courts regarding "what the law is." Supremacy of written constitution. Establishes power of judicial review: Role of Court as interpreter of Constitution. Effect of declaration that statute is inconsistent with Constitution.

[^3]:U.S. v. Carolene Products (1938): Holding/rule: The federal government has the power to prohibit filled milk from being shipped in interstate commerce. Economic regulations are "presumptively constitutional" under a deferential standard of review known as the "rational basis test". **Footnote Four**: The Court will exercise a stricter standard of review when a law appears on its face to violate a provision of the United States Constitution, restricts the political process in a way that could impede the repeal of an undesirable law, or discriminates against "discrete and insular" minorities. Footnote Four would influence later Supreme Court decisions, and the higher standard of review is now known as "strict scrutiny".

[^4]:U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton (1995): Holding/rule: States may not impose qualifications for prospective members of Congress stricter than those specified in the Constitution.

---

### Countermajoritarian Difficulty

"Countermajoritarian difficulty" is the idea that an essential tension exists between a system of representative democracy founded on the principle of majority rule, and a power in non-elected, life-tenured federal judges to negate laws enacted by a majority of the people’s representatives. Hamilton attempted a response to this critique in Federalist No. 78, and many modern commentators question whether the power of judicial review really poses a "countermajoritarian difficulty," since the constitution in many ways is countermajoritarian by design (e.g., the Bill of Rights places certain issues beyond the reach of majorities). Nevertheless, the modern Supreme Court frequently speaks about the "properly limited role of the courts in a representative democracy," to some degree crediting the notion of a countermajoritarian difficulty.

### Source of Judicial Power Article III

**Article III, Section 1 vests jurisdiction:**

*The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.*

**Article III, Section 2 clause 1 enumerates the types of cases over which federal courts have jurisdiction:**

*The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;—to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;—to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;—to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;—to Controversies between two or more States;—between a State and Citizens of another State,—between Citizens of different States,—between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.*

**Article III, Section 2 clause 2 distinguishes original and appellate jurisdiction of Supreme Court:**

*In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.*

---

# Justiciability

Justiciability asks whether a federal court has the power to hear a particular case.  Justiciability encompasses the doctrines of **standing**, **ripeness** and **mootness** (which examine whether particular parties present a justiciable case or controversy) and the “political question” doctrine (which examines whether the issue or claims presented are appropriate for judicial resolution).

---

## Standing

To have standing, a plaintiff must have a sufficient stake in the lawsuit to **(1) give rise to an Article III "case or controversy"** and **(2) satisfy the Supreme Court’s judge-made "prudential limitations."** (only one prudential limit remains after *Lexmark*). Congress may override prudential limitations by statute, but may not override Article III case or controversy limits; i.e., Congress may not authorize lawsuits by parties that do not satisfy the Article III case or controversy requirements (e.g., compare *Lujan* with *Akins*). **Underlying policies** are **adverse presentation of issues** (courts want cases to be vigorously litigated [this ensures fairness]); **autonomy** (favors placing litigation of rights in the hands of those most affected) and **additional separation of powers and federalism considerations**.[^5] [^6] [^7] [^8]

[^5]:Allen v. Wright (1984):Holding/rule: Citizens do not have standing to sue a federal government agency based on the influence that the agency's determinations might have on third parties. "In essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues. Standing doctrine embraces... the general prohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff's complaint fall within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question." The requirement of standing, however, has a core component derived directly from the Constitution. A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief."" **Zone of interests test is no longer part of standing analysis after 2014, but relates instead to whether a particular statute confers a right of action on the plaintiff.** Dissents: Justice Brennan wrote a dissenting opinion complaining that the use of separation of powers is a truism. He opined that the injury of the children's opportunities was enough to grant standing to sue. Justice Stevens wrote that the allegation really is that the government is subsidizing white flight, which is sufficient to allow standing – the harm (lack of desegregated schools) was traceable to government conduct. Stevens also asserted that standing has nothing to do with separation of powers.

[^6]:In *Lexmark v. Static Controls* (2014), the Supreme Court held that zone-of-interest is no longer to be considered part of standing analysis, but relates instead to whether a particular statute confers a right of action on the plaintiff.  The zone-of-interests test will appear as part of the standing rule statement in many pre-2014 judicial opinions; those rule statements are no longer correct.  

[^7]: Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife (1992): Issue: Whether the Endangered Species Act of 1973 applied to development projects in Aswan, Egypt and Mahaweli, Sri Lanka funded by the U.S., that could harm endangered species in  affected areas in the U.S.. Rule: Plaintiffs must suffer a concrete, discernible injury - not a "conjectural or hypothetical one" — to have Article III standing to bring a suit against the U.S. government in federal court. It, in effect, made it more difficult for plaintiffs to challenge the actions of a government agency when the actions don't directly affect them.[2]
Holding: Defenders of Wildlife lacked standing to challenge regulations jointly issued by the U.S. Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce, regarding the geographic area to which a particular section of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 applied.

[^8]:City of Los Angeles v. Lyons (1983): Background: In 1976, Adolph Lyons was stopped by four white LAPD officers for driving with a broken tail light. The unarmed 24-year-old was ordered to leave his vehicle by officers with guns drawn and to spread his legs and put his hands on top of his head. After being frisked, Lyons put his hands down, and an officer put him in a chokehold until he lost consciousness. Lyons woke up lying face down in the road with soiled underwear and blood and dirt in his mouth. The officers gave him a traffic citation and sent him on his way. Seven years later, Lyons sought compensatory damages for the chokehold and declaratory and injunctive relief against the LAPD's chokehold policy. Holding: Lyons failed to allege a sufficiently-plausible threat of future injury to have standing to seek an injunction. Lyons had standing for his damages action since it was retrospective and the injury was concrete and particular. The decision helped to establish the principle that a plaintiff must meet a standing requirement for each form of relief sought.

## Article III case or controversy requirement

1. Injury
2. Causation
3. Redressability

---

### (1) Injury

Injury in fact: plaintiff must show an “injury” that is (a) “concrete” and “particularized” (as opposed to “abstract” and “undifferentiated”); and (b) “actual” or “imminent” (as opposed to “speculative” or “remote”).

An injury is a concrete injury if it is (1) tangible (physical, financial, economic). (2) Intangible injuries may be concrete if they (a) abridge constitutional rights[^9]; (b) infringe upon other intangible interests previously recognized by the Supreme Court;[^10]; (c) are historically recognized injuries[^11].

Congress may create statutory rights the invasion of which constitute concrete injury. However, as the Court stated in Spokeo, a plaintiff does not “automatically” satisfy the injury requirement “whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.”  The Court will decide for itself whether violation of the statutory interest causes a “concrete” injury.  

Violation of a statutorily-created “procedural right” counts as concrete injury if that procedural violation increases “the risk of real harm” to the plaintiff or otherwise affects the plaintiff’s concrete interests. A “bare procedural violation” without more (i.e., absent any impact some “actual,” “concrete” interest of the plaintiff) does not count as a “concrete injury.”

**“Particularized” injury**: Justices all seem to agree that a violation of voting rights affecting an entire population would cause each individual voter a “particularized” injury. “Widely shared harms” (even harms that may extend to the public at large) may nevertheless be “particularized” and count as Article III injury if they are “concrete” and not “abstract.”  For example, wholesale violation of an individual constitutional right (e.g., imposition of a poll tax in violation of the 24th Amendment) would harm all or most citizens, and each of them would have an Article III injury. Each person’s injury would be “particularized”, even though millions of people suffer exactly the same harm.

**“Generalized grievances”**: There is some uncertainty about the extent to which the ban on generalized grievances is a component of the Article III injury requirement or should be considered a non-constitutional “prudential limitation” on standing, as the Court in Allen v. Wright and many earlier cases listed it. But this much seems settled: the ban on generalized grievances, defined narrowly as “suits ‘claiming only harm to [the plaintiff's] and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large’”, must now be considered an Article III constitutional limitation on standing. A “generalized grievance” as defined above involves only “abstract” harm.

**Threatened injury** can give rise to standing if it is “imminent” and not merely “speculative” or “conjectural”.

[^9]:Intangible injuries that abridge constitutional rights can involve free speech, privacy, and other rights.

[^10]:Intangible interests include environmental, aesthetic, and other interests.

[^11]:Historically recognized injuries include Qui Tam actions or bounty actions, which American and English courts have entertained for centuries. The term "qui tam" comes from Latin and is derived from the longer phrase "qui tam pro domino rege quam pro se ipso in hac parte sequitur," which translates to "he who sues in this matter for the king as well as for himself." Legal Definition of qui tam action: an action that is brought by a person on behalf of a government against a party alleged to have violated a statute especially against defrauding the government through false claims and that provides for part of a penalty to go to the person bringing the action.

---

### (2) Causation

The injury must be "fairly traceable" to challenged action.

Note the issue of multiple links in the causal chain, especially where some links in the chain involve actions of third parties not before the court. Multiple links in the causal chain between the challenged action and the injury are not necessarily fatal, but the Court will scrutinize such chains to determine if the causal links are strong enough, especially where the suit seeks an order requiring the government to enforce laws against third parties. The court’s characterization of the injury may affect the length of the causal chain and may alter the causation analysis.

---

### (3) Redressability

An award of relief to the plaintiff must be likely to redress the Article III injury, at least to some extent.  

Prudential standing is satisfied when the injury asserted arguably falls within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute in question. Akins.

---

## Prudential limitations

Prudential limitations are non-constitutional, judge-made limitations on standing. Since these limitations are non-constitutional, they are not binding on Congress. Congress may authorize federal suits by individuals who satisfy Article III case and controversy requirements, irrespective of any prudential limitation.  

As of now, there is only one established prudential limitation. This is the ban on assertion of third party rights.[^12]

[^12]:In Lexmark v. Static Controls (2014), the Supreme Court suggested (but has not yet held) that prudential limitations ordinarily should not prevent federal adjudication of claims that meet the Article III case and controversy requirements.  The Court’s dictum leaves the status of standing doctrine in some doubt. Reasoning: No "generalized grievances:" the Court has said that the federal judiciary should decline on prudential grounds to adjudicate “generalized grievances shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens."" (see also Akins; Richardson; Schlesinger). The ban on generalized grievances is an Article III constitutional limitation on standing, not a prudential limitation. To the extent that the ban on “generalized grievances” described in earlier cases had a broader scope than defined above, it is unclear whether it survives as a prudential limitation (or may in a later case be deemed part of the Art. III injury test.)  

---

### Exceptions

Congress can override the “generalized grievance” concept as a prudential limitation (subject to the standards described in Akins and Spokeo and in the Kennedy concurrence in Lujan.) [^13]

**Rule against Jus Tertii or Third Party:** There is a **general bar against plaintiff assertion of the legal rights of third parties not before the Court**. Justification for this limitation is the idea that the party whose rights are most directly at stake ordinarily should have responsibility and control over litigation of those rights. Therefore, courts should only allow the assertion of a third party’s rights by litigants whose interests are **very closely aligned with the right-holder’s**, and who can be trusted to **advocate vigorously** for the third party’s rights.

[^13]:Flast v. Cohen (1968):  taxpayers have standing to challenge an exercise of Congress’s Article I, sec. 8 taxing and spending power as violative of First Amendment Establishment Clause. (Note that *Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.* (2007) held that taxpayers have no standing to challenge executive branch expenditures as violative of the Establishment Clause.)  

---

### Exceptions to exceptions

Congressional override. Plaintiff must always meet Article III requirements.

Where “enforcement of the challenged restriction against the litigant would result indirectly in the violation of third parties’ rights.” For example, enforcement of the alcohol sales restriction against the Plaintiff bar owner in *Craig v. Boren* would result indirectly in the violation of the equal protection rights of the 18-20 year old men; or enforcement of criminal statutes prohibiting distributing contraceptives against the Plaintiff medical providers in Griswold would result in violation of their patients’ constitutional privacy and reproductive rights.

Where the challenged statute, regulation, etc. would "preclude or otherwise adversely affect a relationship existing between the litigant and the persons whose rights are violated."  (e.g, the relationship between parochial schools and parents in Pierce v. Society of Sisters;  possibly the vendor-vendee relationship in Craig, or doctor-patient relationship in Griswold). This overlaps with the exception where violation of third party rights.

Where there is otherwise a “close relationship” between the litigant and the third party who possesses the right, and “there is a hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his or her own interests.” **The overriding inquiry in assessing the applicability of exceptions is whether the plaintiff will vigorously advocate the rights of the third party.** If the court concludes that the litigant will not vigorously advocate for the rights of the third party or may have different interests from the third party, it will deny standing. 		

(e)	Significance of *City of Los Angeles v. Lyons*: plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each element of relief; the fact that the defendant’s action injured an individual in the past does not necessarily give that individual standing to seek a prospective injunction.  

---

## Ripeness

An issue of ripeness arises where plaintiff’s injury has yet to occur and may be contingent on future events that may or may not come to pass.  

Note the large overlap with standing analysis, which asks whether a “threatened” injury is imminent enough to satisfy the Art. III injury requirement.  The Supreme Court has recognized that in some cases the standing inquiry is the same as the ripeness inquiry.[^14]

The classic case raising a ripeness question is one in which a plaintiff challenges a statutory or regulatory provision before it is actually enforced against that plaintiff.  This is known as an anticipatory suit or a pre-enforcement challenge.

The **modern ripeness test** appeared in *Abbott Labs v. Gardener* (1967).[^15]

To determine whether a case is ripe, the court balances fitness with hardship.

**Fitness** is whether a claim is fit for judicial review to the extent that it raises purely legal questions such as facial challenges to a regulation's or statute’s validity. If a claim raises purely legal questions, it is more likely to be found fit for judicial review because there is little or no benefit to waiting for additional facts to develop. If, however, the resolution of the claim seems to turn on factual circumstances that have not fully emerged at the time review is sought, it may be deemed unfit for judicial review.

**Hardship** is whether delaying adjudication will result in hardship to a party. The typical instance of hardship is where denying pre-enforcement review will put a party to the choice of risking significant sanctions in order to challenge the allegedly illegal government restriction, or suffering an irremediable deprivation by accepting the restriction.[^16]

**Probability of Actual Harm** is another consideration. The court will always consider the probability that the predicted harm will actually occur, either in its fitness analysis, the hardship analysis or as an independent factor.  

[^14]:See *Susan B Anthony List v. Driehaus* (2014) where the Court hinted in dictum that once a plaintiff satisfies the Article III requirement of “imminent” injury, ripeness doctrine poses no further barrier to justiciability.

[^15]:See *Abbott Labs v. Gardener* (1967). Abbott was a pre-enforcement challenge to FDA regulations that would have required the plaintiff drug company to re-label its pharmaceutical products at substantial expense.  The drug company sought a judicial declaration of the regulations’ invalidity before the FDA sought to enforce the regulations against the company.  Absent judicial intervention at this pre-enforcement stage, the plaintiff would be put to the choice of incurring significant expense (in order to abide by the regulations) or intentionally disobeying the regulations at the risk of incurring civil or criminal penalties (in order to have an opportunity to challenge the regulations in court).  The Supreme Court was apparently moved by the drug company’s dilemma and held that the case was ripe.  [Compare the Court’s treatment of the parallel (perhaps sharper) dilemma confronting the workers in the Longshoremen’s’ case and the immigrants in Catholic Social Services.]

[^16]:Abbott is an example of this, as is the Longshoremen’s case and the various cases in which doctors have sought pre-enforcement review of anti-abortion statutes.

## Mootness

When the case is no longer a live "case or controversy" because of subsequent events, it is moot. The "case and controversy" requirements of Article III must be met at every stage of the litigation, from trial through final disposition on appeal (see Honig v. Doe). If a case becomes moot while on appeal, *what happens to the ruling(s) below? (See Rehnquist concurrence in Honig).*

Examples of events that could render a claim "moot:"

1. the legislature might change or repeal the challenged law;
2. the plaintiff’s circumstances could change (e.g., the 18-20 year old male plaintiffs in Craig v. Boren had all reached their 21st birthdays by the time the case reached the Supreme Court;  the claims were therefore moot as to them).

Note: in examples (1) and (2) a claim for money damages would normally survive the changed circumstance; i.e., would not be rendered moot.  (Why?)

**Exceptions/Special Cases:**

(1) disputes that are "capable of repetition yet evading review:" two part test: (a) dispute or challenged conduct must by its nature be too short in duration to be fully litigated through trial and appeal (hence "evading review"); and (b) there must be reasonable expectation that dispute will recur (hence "capable of repetition.")  Normally the recurrence must involve the same parties, but the Court has recognized exceptions to the same-parties requirement (see Scalia dissent in Honig).  Classic examples: pregnant woman challenges abortion law, but pregnancy resolved before the case is decided; prospective voters or candidates challenge election procedures, but the election occurs before the case can be litigated to conclusion.  In the voting and abortion contexts, the Court has not required a showing that the dispute may again embroil the same plaintiff.

(2)	class actions:  as a general rule, a class action survives the mooting of the named plaintiff's (the class representative’s) claim.  Recall the example from class: had the plaintiffs in Craig v. Boren sought certification of a class consisting of all 18-20 year old men wishing to drink beer in Oklahoma, the claims of the class would have continued to present a live case and controversy even after the class representatives’ claims became moot on their 21st birthdays.   Note, though, that the class representative’s claim must be live at the time the suit is filed and class certification is requested, and the claims of the class members must continue to satisfy the case and controversy requirements.

(3)	defendants' voluntary cessation of challenged conduct normally does not render the case moot so long as the defendant is "free to return to his old ways."  E.g., in response to a lawsuit, a welfare administrator voluntarily suspends the enforcement of a discretionary regulation.  This action does not moot the case.  **A case becomes moot as a result of defendants' voluntary cessation of challenged conduct only if the defendant proves that there is no reasonable likelihood of the conduct recurring.**

## Eleventh Amendment State Sovereign Immunity Limitations on Federal Judicial Power

*The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.* Eleventh Amendment.

(a) The 11th Amendment limits (i) federal judicial power; and, (ii) as the Court has elaborated the doctrine, the 11A “presupposes” the existence of state sovereignty principles that limit congressional power to abrogate state sovereign immunity in federal court (Seminole) or in state court (Alden), and also (iii): immunizes state defendants from certain federal administrative proceedings initiated by private parties (Federal Maritime Comm’n). (b) State sovereign immunity ("11A immunity" or "SSI") applies only when a state is the defendant or the "real party in interest" on the defense side. SSI comes into play where the state, a state agency, a state official sued in official capacity, and/or other entities acting as an “arm of the state” are defendants " (see Handout 5, p. 3); there is no SSI if the defendant is a county, city, other political subdivision or local official (unless "arm-of-state"), or state officials sued in their individual capacities. (c) There is no SSI limitation (even if a state is the defendant) where the plaintiff is the United States (including agencies of the U.S.) or another state (cf. Art III, §2); cases involving any other plaintiff (including foreign states) subject to SSI limitations[^6].

**General rule:** State defendants (state, state agency, arm-of-state, state officials in official capacity) are immune from private suits (suits by plaintiffs other than the U.S. or another U.S. state) in any federal or state court or quasi-judicial federal administrative proceeding, unless the state has waived its immunity or Congress has validly abrogated it, or the “Ex Parte Young exception” applies.  

**Ex Parte Young exception:** Private plaintiffs may maintain a federal suit against (a) a state official in official capacity; (b) only for “prospective relief;” (c) on a federal law claim (but not on state law claims); (d) unless Congress has expressed an intent to foreclose Ex parte Young suit (see Seminole Tribe).

Schematic view of 11A impact, assuming (a) suit in federal court; (b) against a "state defendant" (see above); (c) commenced by plaintiffs other than the United States or another state; and (d) State has not waived and Congress has not validly abrogated State's sovereign immunity:

*Understand the theory of Ex Parte Young.  Clarify the impact of Seminole Tribe on the availability of Ex Parte Young actions against state officials.  What is the standard for determining whether Congress intended to foreclose an Ex Parte Young suit?*

**What counts as “prospective relief” allowable in Ex parte Young suit?**  Basic rule is that “relief necessary to halt an ongoing violation of federal law” -- and any "ancillary relief" (relief in aid of the primary relief, such as attorneys’ fees or notice to class members) -- is "prospective" relief permitted by the 11th amendment, even if the relief requires expenditures of state funds.   Relief not necessary to halt a present violation of federal law, but that serves only compensatory or deterrent interests, is "retrospective" relief and is not available through an Ex Parte Young suit.  What is the theoretical basis upon which the Supreme Court justifies drawing this line between permitted prospective relief and prohibited retrospective relief?

Examples:

Edelman: federal court order requiring state, from the date of the order forward, to obey federal law in administering the state’s public assistance program is "prospective" relief; the relief is "necessary to halt an ongoing violation of federal law" and is therefore not barred by the 11A.  By contrast, an order requiring the state to refund all the benefits it illegally withheld in the past is "retrospective" relief; this relief is not necessary to end a continuing violation of federal law, and since the relief would be paid for from the state treasury, it is barred by the 11A.

Milliken v. Bradley:  federal court order that Michigan fund a special education program to remedy the current effects of past de jure desegregation in the public schools, held to be "prospective" relief; current effects of past unconstitutional behavior said to be present constitutional violation; relief is therefore "necessary to halt an ongoing violation of federal law," even though it addresses harms caused by past unconstitutional state action.  

[^6]:**Article III, Section 2 clause 1. *The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; to Controversies between two or more States; between a State and Citizens of another State, between Citizens of different States, between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.*

## Abrogation

Congress may "abrogate" (remove, override) a state’s SSI if:

(a) Congress "unequivocally" expresses its intent to do so in the text of a statute.  Note: the normal rules of statutory construction do not apply here; the Court will not consider legislative history or resort to usual tools of statutory analysis, even though these may reveal a clear congressional intent to override the 11A (see Seminole Tribe); the statute need not use “magic words” (e.g., abrogation, 11th Amendment, sovereign immunity, etc.) but must make clear that it authorizes private suits against a state defendant.

(b) Congress has enacted the statute in the exercise of a constitutional power that the Court finds authorizes nullification of SSI. Thus far, the Court has held that Congress has the authority to abrogate SSI under section 5 of the 14th amendment and has suggested in Seminole Tribe and Alden that no Article I power gives Congress the authority to abrogate.  (Why?)  However, in Katz (2006) the Court held that the bankruptcy clause of Article I §8 itself represents a surrender of states’ state sovereign immunity in certain bankruptcy proceedings.

If Congress "abrogates" a state’s 11A immunity/SSI, the state may be sued to the extent of the abrogation in the same manner as any other defendant.  (Abrogation is not "all or nothing."  For instance Congress might decide to authorize suits only against certain state defendants and/or only for some specified relief -- as it did in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.)

---

### The meaning of Alden

States have a constitutional immunity from federal law claims brought by individuals in the state’s own courts.  Congress may not abrogate this immunity unless exercising its power under §5 of the 14th amendment (or, presumably, under other powers conferred on Congress at the expense of state autonomy after adoption of the 11th amendment).  Alden holds, in essence, that the same state sovereign immunity rules applicable in federal court apply equally to private suits alleging federal claims against states in their own courts.

---

## Waiver

States may "waive" their 11A immunity, but the Court has set an extremely high threshold for finding waiver, and construes waivers narrowly. (As with abrogation, waiver is not "all or nothing."  A state that has waived its immunity may be sued only to the extent of the waiver, which be qualified, e.g., limited to certain forms of relief.)  General waivers of sovereign immunity by a state have been held insufficient to waive 11A immunity; the Supreme Court requires that the state expressly waive its immunity to suit in federal court in order for a federal action to go forward.  The Court will not imply waiver from a state’s participation in a federal program and agreement to obey federal standards, and the Court seems unwilling to find any constructive waiver of state sovereign immunity (e.g. Edelman) except where a State’s litigation actions amount to a consent to federal jurisdiction.  E.g., Lapides v. Bd. of Regents (2002) (implied waiver of SSI where state agency voluntarily removed a lawsuit from state court to federal court).  Congress may require states to waive their 11A immunity as a condition of receiving federal funds, and courts will enforce the waiver if Congress has set forth the condition in very clear terms. (This is in essence another “clear statement rule,” akin to the “clear statement rule” applied in the abrogation context.) (Cf. Pennhurst)

The meaning of Federal Maritime Comm’n:  states enjoy immunity from federal administrative proceedings that (a) closely resemble judicial proceedings and (b) are initiated by a private party.  What was the Court’s rationale for extending state sovereign immunity principles to administrative proceedings used by the federal executive to enforce federal law?  What elements of the administrative proceeding here led the majority to conclude that the proceedings were functionally indistinguishable from a judicial proceeding?  (Notice that the administrative law judge could not order any immediate relief against the state, but that did not alter the majority’s conclusion.  Why not?)  Can a federal agency subject states to any administrative processes or proceedings after Federal Maritime?

## Federal Legislative Power

**Basic Principle:** Federal government is one of limited and enumerated powers; an Act of Congress is valid only if (a) it is affirmatively authorized by the Constitution and (b) it is not barred by some prohibition in the Constitution (see e.g., Art. I § 9; the Bill of Rights, etc).   

**Sources of Congressional Power:** Main source is Article I, § 8, though other constitutional provisions (e.g.  Articles III and V and section 5 of the fourteenth amendment) also confer power on Congress.  Review [Article I, § 8](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-628j-patents-copyrights-and-the-law-of-intellectual-property-spring-2013/readings/MIT15_628JS13_read02.pdf) to know the scope and kinds of congressional power.

---

## Necessary and Proper Clause

**Basic test** (first set out in *McCulloch* and later modified by *Darby* to eliminate judicial inquiry into "pretext" or hidden congressional motive). Congressional action need only bear some rational connection to a goal within Congress's constitutionally delegated authority in order to be upheld under the necessary and proper clause.  

Modern Court professes to follow the McCulloch standard.  Rule: Legislation that rationally advances a goal entrusted by the Constitution to Congress (or to other departments of the national gov’t) is constitutional so long as the legislation does not conflict with an “external limitation” (e.g. the prohibitions of the Bill of Rights or Art. I, § 9 ).

Note that recent Supreme Court decisions have limited congressional discretion in choice of means with respect to the commerce power (e.g., Lopez and Morrison) and with respect to the civil rights power (e.g., City of Boerne).  [Note for your interest (not for the midterm exam) that Comstock (the 2010 case upholding a federal civil commitment statute – text p 216) gives a highly deferential account of the Necessary and Proper Clause, under which the statutes voided by the Rehnquist Court’s federalism decisions (e.g., Lopez, Morrison, Garret, Kimel, cf. NFIB v. Sebelius) would have passed constitutional muster.]

## Commerce Power

Source: [Article I, sec. 8, cl. 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-8); classic interpretation of the commerce clause appears in Gibbons v. Ogden.

The following principles governed the scope of the commerce power before Lopez and Morrison:

1. The "significant" or "substantial" effects test:  Congress can regulate any activity that substantially affects interstate commerce, even if the regulated activity is not itself either "interstate" or "commerce."  (E.g. NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin; Heart of Atlanta; McClung).

2. The "aggregate" or "cumulative effect" rule:  Congress can regulate activities that, considered one by one, would have no effect on interstate commerce as long as the cumulative effect of that class of activities nationally would have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.  (Wickard, Perez, Heart of Atlanta; McClung).

3. The irrelevance of congressional motivation:  Congress may directly regulate interstate commerce for any reason, even if Congress’s "real" purpose is to achieve some goal that would otherwise be outside its constitutional authority.  E.g., in Darby, Congress prohibited the interstate transport of goods produced by workers receiving below the federal minimum wage; this is a constitutional exercise of the commerce power, even if Congress’s "real" purpose was to regulate wage rates not interstate commerce.  Similarly, in Heart of Atlanta and McClung, the Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a constitutional exercise of the commerce power, even though Congress’s primary goal was not the regulation of interstate commerce, but the advancement of racial equality and human rights and equal citizenship.

4. Rational basis standard: the courts defer heavily to congressional assertions that a particular activity "substantially affects" interstate commerce or that a particular congressional regulation furthers a federal end (like the regulation of interstate commerce.)   If there is any reasonable basis for such congressional assertions (formal findings are not required) the courts will accept them.  (E.g. Perez). The question on rational basis review is not whether the regulated activity actually has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but rather whether Congress could have rationally concluded that the regulated activity has such an effect.

*What does Lopez (as interpreted by Morrison) do to this analysis?*

*What are the three categories of permissible commerce clause legislation under Lopez?*  

*How will the Court apply the "substantial effects" test after Lopez and Morrison?*
	• What's the analysis if the regulated activity is "economic"?   
	• What's the analysis if the regulated activity is deemed to be "non-economic"?  
	• Under what circumstances may Congress regulate "non-economic" activity under the commerce clause and what is the standard of review?  See, e.g., Raich (the medical marijuana case.)  

[A summary of the Commerce Power after Lopez and Morrison is attached to this outline as an addendum – please review it.]

### Commerce Power After Lopez and Morrison

*U.S. v. Lopez* (1995) - Categories of Permissible Commerce Clause Legislation

Congress may:

1.   Regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.
2.   Regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come from intrastate activities.
3.   Regulate activities that have a substantial relation to interstate commerce or that substantially affect interstate commerce.

For category 3 (the substantial effects test):

**If the regulated activity is “ECONOMIC”:** the Wickard aggregation rule applies; the court asks whether Congress could rationally conclude that the regulated activity, considered in the aggregate nationally, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.  (The answer is invariably yes.)

**If the regulated activity is “NON-ECONOMIC”:** our working rule is that the court will NOT consider the aggregate impact of “non-economic” activity in determining whether Congress may regulate that activity under the substantial effects test.

Under what circumstances may Congress regulate “non-economic” activity under the commerce clause?

1.  If the legislation fits into Lopez category 1 or 2 (above).
2.  If the regulation of “non-economic activity” is an essential part of a broader regulation of “economic” activity (e.g., *Gonzalez v. Raich*).
3.  Through a statute with a jurisdictional element limiting the statute’s application case-by-case to activity having a nexus with interstate commerce. (See the amended Gun Free School Zones Act.)

Raich:  In determining whether a regulation of non-economic activity is “an essential part of a broader regulation of economic activity” the court asks whether Congress could rationally conclude that “failure to regulate that class of [non-economic] activity would undercut” Congress’s broader regulation of economic activity.  (In other words, Congress may consider the cumulative impact of a non-economic activity for purposes of determining whether regulation of that activity is essential to a broader economic regulatory scheme.)  In Raich, Congress could consider not only whether failure to regulate the plaintiff’s medical marijuana plants would undercut regulation of the marijuana market – it could consider whether failure to regulate that activity in the aggregate (i.e., all home-grown medical marijuana) would undermine its broader economic regulation.

*What does the NFIB v. Sebelius (the Affordable Care Act case) do to the doctrine?* (assuming CJ Roberts' opinion regarding the commerce power – though formally dictum – reflects the approach that a majority of the Court endorses.) Note:  the impact (if any) of Sebelius on commerce power doctrine will NOT be tested on the Midterm.

## Tenth Amendment

[Will NOT be on the Midterm]

The Tenth Amendment currently does not operate as a limit on Congress' power under Article I to (a) regulate private activities or (b) regulate state activities through federal statutes of general applicability (federal statutes that apply equally to state entities and private entities, such as the minimum wage law in Garcia).  In addition, the Tenth Amendment does not limit Congress’s civil rights powers (e.g. section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment). Why not?

With regard to federal statutes that are directed solely at states "in their capacity as sovereigns" (or at state or local officials) the Court will inquire into whether the regulation invades a core sphere of state sovereignty.   This is the rule first set forth in New York v. United States.  The Court there held that federal legislation attempting to "commandeer state legislative processes" by requiring a state legislature to enact federal regulatory standards impermissibly violates state sovereignty.  And in Printz, the Court flatly held that Congress may not order State or local executive or law enforcement officials "to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program."   

By contrast, the Court in these cases recognized that Congress may make federal funds contingent upon state adoption and enforcement of federal standards (so long as the federal inducement does not rise to the level of "coercion") and that Congress may still preempt state action (nullify state acts that touch upon area over which Congress has constitutional authority). Printz also confirms that the Tenth Amendment does not prevent Congress from requiring state judges to enforce federal law.  

Issues to consider:  what counts as legislation directed solely at states or at "states in their sovereign capacity"?  (Why did the Court uphold the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act in Reno v. Condon?)  What counts as "coercion" under the N.Y. v. U.S. analysis? Under Sebelius (the Obamacare case)? Suppose a state legislature had to enact statutory amendments in order to comply with the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.  Does that pose a tenth amendment problem?  Why (not)?

The meaning of Murphy v. NCAA: In essence the Court held that Congress may not (at least though exercise of an Article I power) “issue direct orders to state legislatures” – even if the congressional “order” purports to bar a state legislature from acting as opposed to requiring a state legislature to act (as in New York v U.S.)  [Although the 10th amendment bars Congress from ordering a state legislature not to enact certain laws, Congress may preempt (render null) any laws the state adopts so long as Congress is acting within its delegated powers.]

For example, in Murphy itself, nothing would prevent Congress from outlawing sports betting directly, in which case any law that New Jersey enacted authorizing such betting would be preempted and void under the Supremacy Clause.  What bothered the Murphy Court was that Congress issued an order to state legislatures prohibiting them from adopting such laws.

## Civil Rights Enforcement Power

[Will NOT be tested on the midterm, **but you are expected to know that Congress may abrogate state sovereign immunity through a valid exercise of the civil rights power**.]

Sources: Sec. 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment; Sec. 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment; Sec. 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment

Scope of Power

Q: Can Congress, under its power to enforce the 14th amendment, outlaw state activity that the Supreme Court has held not to violate the 14th amendment?  What is the test laid down in Morgan?  In Boerne?

The Supreme Court has held that section 5 grants Congress a broad power -- akin to its “necessary and proper” power -- to select the means to carry out the goals of the 14th amendment.  A statute is “appropriate legislation” under section 5 of the 14th amendment if it is “plainly adapted” to securing due process or equal protection and is “not prohibited by, but is consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution.”  

Boerne held that Congress’s section 5 power is solely remedial. Congress may not alter the substance of fourteenth amendment rights. [Boerne rejected the “substantive theory” of section 5 that some had discerned in Morgan.]

Congress may legislate to "remedy, prevent or deter" violations of 14th amendment rights, and it may choose to prohibit conduct that is not itself unconstitutional as the means of remedying, preventing or deterring constitutional violations.  However, after Boerne, there must be a “congruence and proportionality” between the 14th amendment injury Congress seeks to deter or remedy and the means Congress adopts to achieve that end.   (Understand why the Court concluded that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act failed this "congruence and proportionality" test.)

Q: How does Kimel refine the test for determining whether Congress has acted within its section 5 power?

Q: What was the Court’s theory for upholding the Family and Medical Leave Act in Hibbs? Does that case suggest that the test and/or judicial methodology in section 5 cases is different when Congress seeks to protect a “suspect” or “quasi-suspect” class?  How?  Is Hibbs consistent with Morrison?  Does Coleman (holding that Congress did not have authority under section 5 to enact the "self-care" provision of the FMLA) alter the rule in Hibbs?  The approach to section 5 analysis?  

Q: What was the Court’s theory for upholding Title II of the ADA as applied to the actions challenged in Lane? What is the significance of the fact that the Court allowed the government to defend the statute “as applied?”  See also U.S. v. Georgia on this point.

Q: What rule emerges from Shelby County (invalidating section 5 of the Voting Rights Act)?  Though the Court confines its analysis to Congress's power under the Fifteenth Amendment, does this case have any significance for the scope of congressional power under the Fourteenth Amendment?

Clarify the differences between civil rights statutes based on the Thirteenth Amendment or other constitutional provisions (such as the right to travel) which do not have a state action component, with civil rights statutes based on the Fourteenth Amendment.

Note: federal civil rights legislation enacted in the 1960s, which provide remedies against purely private conduct in a variety of areas such as public accommodations (Heart of Atlanta and McClung), employment, and housing, for example, have been sustained as exercises of Congress' Commerce Power, not its Civil Rights Enforcement Power.  [See the concurring opinions in Heart of Atlanta and McClung for the view that these statutes should have been upheld on the basis of the Civil Rights Powers and that the Civil Rights Cases  (l883), which limited the Fourteenth Amendment to actions of the state (the state action doctrine), should have been overruled.]  Note also that in striking down the Violence Against Women Act (in Morrison) the Supreme Court relied upon and reaffirmed the Civil Rights Cases.

## Taxing Power  

[will NOT be tested on the midterm]

Source: Article I, sec. 8, cl. 1.

Scope of the taxing power.

Note purposes of the taxing power: sec. 8, cl 1: pay the debt, provide for the common defense and the "general welfare" of the U.S.  A tax must have as a purpose the achievement of one of these goals.

"general welfare" in this context is not limited to Congress’s enumerated powers;  Congress may tax in order to advance any general public good, and the courts give Congress near unreviewable discretion to decide what the public good or “general welfare” comprehends.

Distinction between revenue-raising and regulation:

Regulation by means of a tax is always permissible (absent some “external” prohibition, like the Bill of Rights) if:

1. the regulation is merely "incidental" to the tax; or
2. Congress has constitutional authority to regulate an activity, independent of its taxing power;  it can then employ tax measures as a "necessary and proper" means to achieve the regulation. (e.g. Congress’s power over currency gave it independent authority to regulate state-issued banknotes: a prohibitively high tax on such notes -- even if considered "regulatory" and not "revenue-raising" -- would be sustained as necessary and proper to the implementation of the independent federal power to regulate currency).

---

## Spending Power

[Spending power will not be tested on midterm **except to the extent that we discussed it in the context of state sovereign immunity:** you should know that Congress may use the spending power to induce States to ‘waive’ state sovereign immunity, for instance by making such a waiver a condition of state receipt of certain federal funds. (Congress must set forth the condition clearly in order for the Court to conclude that a state’s acceptance of federal funds works a waiver of immunity.)]  

Source: Article I, sec. 8, cl. 1.  Congress may tax and spend to pay the national debt, to provide for the common defense, and to advance the “general welfare” of the United States.

Scope:

"General welfare" of the U.S. is broader than the enumerated powers of Congress. (Butler).  Congress has wide, and perhaps unreviewable, authority to define the "general welfare" for which it may make appropriations. (Dole)

Congress may accomplish regulatory goals by imposing conditions on spending which require promises or contracts between the federal government and the recipient, whether the recipient is a private individual or a state. (Steward Machine).  The 10th amendment does not prevent Congress from using its spending power to influence or regulate areas of traditional state concern.

Congress may condition a state’s receipt of federal funds on the state’s agreement to abide by certain federal directives (including adopting federal policies, administering federal laws or programs and waiving state sovereign immunity); but the Court has announced that under some extreme circumstances, attaching conditions to federal funds may amount to coercion and therefore exceed the scope of the spending power. (South Dakota v. Dole).

Spending will be constitutional if (Dole):

1. the spending is designed to advance the general welfare of the U.S. (note: the Court gives Congress very great deference to determine what constitutes "the general welfare.");
2. the conditions attached to the receipt of federal funds are unambiguous, at least where the condition is imposed on federal grants to states;
3. the conditions are in some way "related" to the federal interest in the particular national projects or programs funded (e.g. if Congress conditioned a state's receipt of federal highway funds on the state's adoption of a federally specified kindergarten curriculum for public schools, that would raise an issue of relatedness);
4. the conditions do not require the recipient of the federal funds (at least if the recipient is a state) to violate some other constitutional provision, e.g. the bill of rights.

Q. NFIB v. Sebelius elaborated on (some would say altered) conditional spending doctrine, holding that Affordable Care Act impermissibly coerced states into expanding their federally-funded Medicaid programs. What is the Court's definition of "coercion"?  Does this coercion analysis ever apply if Congress simply offers states money to operate a program on condition that the state follow federal directives for how the program is to be operated?  Why did the Court try to distinguish “existing Medicaid” from “ACA Medicaid”?

**"Unconstitutional Conditions" doctrine** [this will not be tested on the midterm or the final, but you should be aware of it]: Under some circumstances, the Court has held that Congress may not condition an important benefit on the waiver of a constitutional right, or "penalize" the exercise of a constitutional right by withholding a benefit; this is known as the "unconstitutional conditions" doctrine.  The Court has scaled back this doctrine in recent years.  Recall cases discussed in class: James (welfare/4th amendment); Rust (medical assistance/1st amendment); Lyng v. UAW (food stamps/1st amendment).

## External Constraints on Congressional Powers

Note that implicit and explicit prohibitions in the original constitution’s text (e.g., Article I, section 9) and the Bill of Rights, including the subsequent Amendments, operate as a constraint on the exercise of all the powers of Congress.  How does the 10th amendment figure in this structure (is it an external constraint?)  What about the 11th amendment?
