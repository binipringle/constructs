## Origin and scope  

Evidentiary rules were originally developed as part of common law. In the 1960s, the Supreme Court appointed an advisory committee to draft a code of evidentiary rules for federal courts, which presented a first draft in 1972 and in 1975 a bill that was codified by act of Congress as PL 93–595, JANUARY 2, 1975, 88 Stat 1926.

The FRE apply in civil and criminal cases and proceedings in federal courts, and to contempt proceedings, except those in which the court may act summarily. The FRE do not govern proceedings before the U.S. Supreme Court nor apply to administrative agencies but agencies can adopt the FRE if they choose or are required (for example, the IRS requires their use in Tax Court).

## Policy

Both frcp and fre want to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding. This is not a bad thing.

Justice delayed is justice denied

I can touch back on these things when I make policy arguments. If you let in one expert you should let in my expert and this will cause delay and be expensive. I can make an argument saying that doing x is going to cause unnecessary expense and delay.


Valentine never saw policy reason where so argued that allowing evidence would promote the development of evidence law.

People always try to bring in evidence. Rules give reasons we keep it out.

Throughout the cases we read we will see that the jurors are often distrusted.

Policy reason to exclude evidence to protect an important social interest or relationship: for example, I ran over kid and cleaned my car. Spousal privilege/marital privilege. I told my spouse I ran over the kid. The spouse can’t testify against spouse. Attorney-client privilege. Doctor left sponge in patient. Nurse saw. Can nurse testify? (not sure if this was the example).

Don’t look for a rule that says yes that’s him. Create a process where im checking off the rules I think are triggered.

Bias: insert in toc after Rule 605. Judge’s Competency as a Witness
And Rule 606. Juror’s Competency as a Witness. Insert bias.

Bringing in character witnesses – is that fair? Clump evidence. Toc of any rule-based thing can give you the policy and also help you see into how they are set up – it didn’t just happen – ppl put time and thought into clumping these rules. Think about that – may help my learning of the rules along.
