Evidentiary rules were originally developed as part of common law. In the 1960s, the Supreme Court appointed an advisory committee to draft a code of evidentiary rules for federal courts, which presented a first draft in 1972 and in 1975 a bill that was codified by act of Congress as PL 93â€“595, JANUARY 2, 1975, 88 Stat 1926.

The FRE apply in civil and criminal cases and proceedings in federal courts, and to contempt proceedings, except those in which the court may act summarily. The FRE do not govern proceedings before the U.S. Supreme Court nor apply to administrative agencies but agencies can adopt the FRE if they choose or are required (for example, the IRS requires their use in Tax Court).
