Biggest mistake students make when doing a 403 analysis is they jump to prejudice. I should first explain why it’s probative, and then explain why its prejudicial. Prejudice must substantially outweigh the probative value.

Process (steps) for doing problems and reading cases:

1.	What is the evidence at issue?
2.	Which side offers it?
3.	What is the evidence offered to prove? AKA Why is it being offered? (remember that one piece of evidence may be admitted for one thing and not for another)
a.	If the problem doesn’t tell you, then ask:
i.	What’s the cause of action, defense, credibility, and/or background issues
ii.	Why would the proponent want to get this evidence admitted > to establish what specific fact conclusion?
4.	Which FRE(s) is/are triggered? What are the elements? Any exceptions apply?
a.	Have your elementized outline of the trigerred FRE before you apply it.
b.	Which specific element is triggered by the facts?
5.	Articulate in one sentence what is the rule/principle or concept that the problem is illustrating. (i.e. categorizing the problems)

Hearsay evidence is generally inadmissible but can be brought in for something else.
