Biggest mistake students make when doing a 403 analysis is they jump to prejudice. I should first explain why it’s probative, and then explain why its prejudicial. Prejudice must substantially outweigh the probative value.

Process (steps) for doing problems and reading cases:

1.	What is the evidence at issue?
2.	Which side offers it?
3.	What is the evidence offered to prove? AKA Why is it being offered? (remember that one piece of evidence may be admitted for one thing and not for another)
a.	If the problem doesn’t tell you, then ask:
i.	What’s the cause of action, defense, credibility, and/or background issues
ii.	Why would the proponent want to get this evidence admitted > to establish what specific fact conclusion?
4.	Which FRE(s) is/are triggered? What are the elements? Any exceptions apply?
a.	Have your elementized outline of the trigerred FRE before you apply it.
b.	Which specific element is triggered by the facts?
5.	Articulate in one sentence what is the rule/principle or concept that the problem is illustrating. (i.e. categorizing the problems)

Hearsay evidence is generally inadmissible but can be brought in for something else.

Steps of analysis: The question is whether the statements or conduct were intended to be part of the negotiations toward compromise. Look for: a clear dispute or disagreement communicated between parties > a clear intent to compromise (after dispute) > whether the offer was unilateral or bilateral > whether the offer was concrete or vague > whether the offer was in response to another offer > whether litigation was threatened or started > attorneys or formal negotiations > “legalese” > distinction between business discussions and legal negotiations.

Full set of rules for Rule 405 analysis: Rule 404(a)(1) generally prohibits evidence of a person’s character or character trait to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait. The rationale is to focus the jury on particular actions of parties and not on their “character” because (1) people do not always act according to character making character evidence not particularly probative; and (2) the drafters of the rules do not want the jury to make propensity-based decisions as this would be unfairly prejudicial jury misuse. There are exceptions to this rule. One exception is Rule 608, which allows a witness’s character for untruthfulness to come in for impeachment purposes by allowing testimony about reputation and opinion, and questions about specific prior conduct on cross-examination, but allows no extrinsic evidence. Other exceptions are in Rule 404(a)(2) aka the Mercy Rule which provides that a defendant in a criminal case may offer evidence of the defendant’s pertinent trait and evidence of an alleged victim’s pertinent trait except if the alleged victim is an alleged sex-offense victim, and, in a homicide case, the prosecutor may offer evidence of the alleged victim’s trait of peacefulness to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor. Rule 405 lays out methods of proving character. Under Rule 405(a), when evidence of a person’s character or character trait is admissible, the character or character trait may be proved by testimony about the person’s reputation or opinion about the person’s character. Under Rule 405(b), when a person’s character or character trait is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, the character or trait may also be proved by relevant specific instances of the person’s conduct. When character evidence is an element, character can be proved in any way the rules provide, and there is no bar on extrinsic evidence. Character evidence is an element in disputes about child custody26, defamation27, negligent entrustment28, and in the defense of entrapment29.The court can always rule on a Rule 403 objection and decide to exclude any character evidence (403 backstop). Unfair prejudice will generally be jury misuse or overvaluing of character evidence.
